      <description>I created this site initially to pretend that I am an arts student. But surprisingly enough, I am spending a whole lot of time trying to add more stuff to this site. And not just in terms of html. I am actually adding and planning more content.&#xA;After I was done writing the first story here , &amp;ldquo;The River That Carries The Sky&amp;rdquo; , I am already working on the next story &amp;ldquo;Dear Kafka&amp;rdquo;, not to mention the amount of songs I am generating and editing to put in here.</description>

      <description>I like to write stories. But sometimes, I am curious as to how many people actually read them. So for a brief moment, I thought- &amp;ldquo;how about I find out how many people read my stories ?&amp;rdquo; But to do so, I had to create some js tracker on my site (maybe github provides one by default, I don&amp;rsquo;t know), but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be stalking ? Why is it my business to know how many people visited my site.</description>

      <description>Just to get this out of the picture. I already have another site&#xA;However, that one was meant to be a personal portfolio of sorts. But now I realize that I have no use of a personal portfolio. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m going to get a job anyway, so why bother with one. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll live for long, so I decided to do whatever I liked until I died.</description>
