<h1>My greatest weakness ? Maybe ?</h1>

    <p>Ok this is wierd.
I am the most broken person among those I&rsquo;ve seen.
Atleast among fellow science students anyway.
So of course I&rsquo;m an emotional mess.
But, but there is some strange thing I like to do - bully people.
By bully I don&rsquo;t mean actually bully people, but more like tease them.
And some people do get offended. I&rsquo;m sort of wary of that.
But that&rsquo;s alright. It&rsquo;s expected of people to get offended.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is when people get offended if you help them, or help someone else.
Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a person X who I see is having issues with arranging their notes or something.
Now I see this and suggest that they pin them together and give them a label or something.
Very simple interaction, right ? Maybe I could have come up with a better one, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Now, in this case , it&rsquo;s totally up to X to decide whether to listen or not. I don&rsquo;t care either way.
For all I know, I don&rsquo;t even know this person X at all, so I would mind my business either way.
But no, another person Y sees this and they get all offended.
Y starts yelling at me telling that X is free to do whatever they want and that I shouldn&rsquo;t be telling them what to do.
Ok.. fine, I guess ? I don&rsquo;t know who either X or Y is, and I don&rsquo;t care either, but I try to say chill , sort of, just in case.
So I tell Y that they&rsquo;re right, and that I only suggested that to X because I personally found it useful.
At this point , I expect a &lsquo;Yeah whatever bro&rsquo;. But then Y goes on about how X should do things in their own style and that now I have received my second warning.
Any more talking like this and action will be taken against me.</p>
<p>What the heck ?
Bro what did I even do ?
I myself don&rsquo;t care that much about what I said.
Why&rsquo;re you blowing this out of proportion ?</p>
<p>I just leave.
Like literally, if I say or do anything more, I&rsquo;ll probably be prosecuted or something.
Who the hell are they anyway ? Entitled people ? I just met them like , five minutes before that conversation.
I have had the unfortunate privilege of meeting a lot of people like this.
I don&rsquo;t know , it&rsquo;s almost as if these kinds of people <em>want</em> to be offended.
I&rsquo;m just chill man. Just saying.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is going on in your life or what your relation is , but why threaten me out of nowhere ? That&rsquo;s creepy.
Actually q I&rsquo;d sort of like to go to jail.Atleast I&rsquo;d be fed there. My job prospects are horrible after graduation, that too <em>if</em> I manage to graduate.
Maybe I should speak to these kinds of people more ?
That would be nice, right ? Just go talk to someone and you get taken to a place where you get free food for the next six months.
But my brain has some weird issue.
Everytime I walk away from these kinds of situations, I feel a lasting burn in my chest area.
I have no fucking clue why , but it does happen and that feeling stays for a long time.
Maybe I need medication ? Is that a normal human response ?</p>
<p>Now that I think about it , one of these events was when my downward spiral started.
I had this exact same feeling during first year of college due to some people and I had that burning sensation for almost a month.
I&rsquo;m not making this up- it was physically unbearable pain.
And this is oming from someone who breaks his nails, scratches himself until he bleeds and pokes a compass at himself regularly.
Those things are less painful than this burning feeling.
It really hurts man.
And I couldn&rsquo;t even tell anyone.
No one would believe me.
Definitely not my family.
I had to sit in my room for a whole month not attending classes and exams and then started losing all hope.
The pain was unbearable man.
This is genuinely where my life started falling apart.
I did face subsequent bouts of this, but none was harder than the first.
Maybe it&rsquo;s a medical condition ?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>All I know is that it hurts.
And it hurts more than any other pain I&rsquo;ve experienced.
And I&rsquo;ve experienced a lot of pain. Physical pain.
On a regular basis.
But by far, this hurts most.</p>
