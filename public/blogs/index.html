				<h2>My greatest weakness ? Maybe ?</h2>
					        <h3> Approximate Reading Time : 4 minutes </h3>
			</div>
	</a>
	<h3>Summary</h3>				
					<p>Ok this is wierd.
I am the most broken person among those I&rsquo;ve seen.
Atleast among fellow science students anyway.
So of course I&rsquo;m an emotional mess.
But, but there is some strange thing I like to do - bully people.
By bully I don&rsquo;t mean actually bully people, but more like tease them.
And some people do get offended. I&rsquo;m sort of wary of that.
But that&rsquo;s alright. It&rsquo;s expected of people to get offended.</p>

				<h2>About the Tao Teh Ching</h2>
					        <h3> Approximate Reading Time : 2 minutes </h3>
			</div>
	</a>
	<h3>Summary</h3>				
					<p>So I&rsquo;ve read around five different translations of the Tao Teh Ching. One particular one, I&rsquo;ve read around twenty times.
I think that it is quite a nice book. It states too many things that are quite relevant, but it&rsquo;s so damn cryptic that half the time I feel that I&rsquo;m the one making up the meanings in the book.
Actually , now that I think about it , that might be the case.</p>

				<h2>Why Am I So Interested ?</h2>
					        <h3> Approximate Reading Time : 3 minutes </h3>
			</div>
	</a>
	<h3>Summary</h3>				
					<p>I created this site initially to pretend that I am an arts student.
But surprisingly enough, I am spending a whole lot of time trying to add more stuff to this site.
And not just in terms of html. I am actually adding and planning more content.</p>
<p>After I was done writing the first story here , &ldquo;The River That Carries The Sky&rdquo; , I am already working on the next story &ldquo;Dear Kafka&rdquo;,
not to mention the amount of songs I am generating and editing to put in here.</p>

				<h2>On Tracking People on the Web</h2>
					        <h3> Approximate Reading Time : 3 minutes </h3>
			</div>
	</a>
	<h3>Summary</h3>				
					<p>I like to write stories.
But sometimes, I am curious as to how many people actually read them.
So for a brief moment, I thought- &ldquo;how about I find out how many people read my stories ?&rdquo;
But to do so, I had to create some js tracker on my site (maybe github provides one by default, I don&rsquo;t know),
but wouldn&rsquo;t that be stalking ? Why is it my business to know how many people visited my site.</p>

				<h2>The Reason for Creating Another Blog</h2>
					        <h3> Approximate Reading Time : 4 minutes </h3>
			</div>
	</a>
	<h3>Summary</h3>				
					<p>Just to get this out of the picture. I already have another <a href="https://devanand-pa.github.io">site</a></p>
<p>However, that one was meant to be a personal portfolio of sorts. But now I realize that I have no use of a personal portfolio.
It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to get a job anyway, so why bother with one. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll live for long, so I decided to do whatever I liked until I died.
I tried browsing the internet and found out that it was not interesting. Just to be sure, I never had an instagram account or anything, and the only time I had a facebook account was nearly a decade ago, which I used to play some browser games once a month or so.</p>
