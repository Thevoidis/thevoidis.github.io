      <description>Foreword So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a story. Yes , a story, I get it. Very unlike me. But I have actually written a lot of stories in school. Most of them got lost, and those that are left are better left untold. But I realized something about them. I hate the whole &amp;lsquo;make it an art&amp;rsquo; thing. I do not like decorating a story with words that don&amp;rsquo;t belong there.</description>

      <description>Ok this is wierd. I am the most broken person among those I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Atleast among fellow science students anyway. So of course I&amp;rsquo;m an emotional mess. But, but there is some strange thing I like to do - bully people. By bully I don&amp;rsquo;t mean actually bully people, but more like tease them. And some people do get offended. I&amp;rsquo;m sort of wary of that. But that&amp;rsquo;s alright. It&amp;rsquo;s expected of people to get offended.</description>

      <description>Kyton The eyes were always there. Not real eyes, not reflections in a rain-slicked window or the passing glance of a stranger on the street. These were heavier. They pressed against the inside of his skull, a phantom weight behind his own gaze. Freedom? Freedom was a word for people who didn&amp;rsquo;t carry their own courtroom inside their head.&#xA;Kyton was a man who could disappear any day. No one would notice or care.</description>

      <title>About the Tao Teh Ching</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve read around five different translations of the Tao Teh Ching. One particular one, I&amp;rsquo;ve read around twenty times. I think that it is quite a nice book. It states too many things that are quite relevant, but it&amp;rsquo;s so damn cryptic that half the time I feel that I&amp;rsquo;m the one making up the meanings in the book. Actually , now that I think about it , that might be the case.</description>

      <description>I created this site initially to pretend that I am an arts student. But surprisingly enough, I am spending a whole lot of time trying to add more stuff to this site. And not just in terms of html. I am actually adding and planning more content.&#xA;After I was done writing the first story here , &amp;ldquo;The River That Carries The Sky&amp;rdquo; , I am already working on the next story &amp;ldquo;Dear Kafka&amp;rdquo;, not to mention the amount of songs I am generating and editing to put in here.</description>

      <title>On Tracking People on the Web</title>

      <description>I like to write stories. But sometimes, I am curious as to how many people actually read them. So for a brief moment, I thought- &amp;ldquo;how about I find out how many people read my stories ?&amp;rdquo; But to do so, I had to create some js tracker on my site (maybe github provides one by default, I don&amp;rsquo;t know), but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be stalking ? Why is it my business to know how many people visited my site.</description>

      <title>The Reason for Creating Another Blog</title>

      <description>Just to get this out of the picture. I already have another site&#xA;However, that one was meant to be a personal portfolio of sorts. But now I realize that I have no use of a personal portfolio. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m going to get a job anyway, so why bother with one. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll live for long, so I decided to do whatever I liked until I died.</description>

      <description>Prologue There are rivers that carve mountains, shaping the land over centuries. And then there are rivers that carry the sky&amp;mdash;holding reflections of the heavens upon their surface, never grasping, never keeping, only flowing onward.&#xA;I have lived like such a river.&#xA;Once, in a childhood half-forgotten, I reached for the sky. I spoke with an angel who whispered of wisdom hidden in the rustling leaves and the hush of the wind.</description>
