      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to write stories.&#xA;But sometimes, I am curious as to how many people actually read them.&#xA;So for a brief moment, I thought- &amp;ldquo;how about I find out how many people read my stories ?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But to do so, I had to create some js tracker on my site (maybe github provides one by default, I don&amp;rsquo;t know),&#xA;but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be stalking ? Why is it my business to know how many people visited my site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just to get this out of the picture. I already have another &lt;a href=&#34;https://devanand-pa.github.io&#34;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that one was meant to be a personal portfolio of sorts. But now I realize that I have no use of a personal portfolio.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m going to get a job anyway, so why bother with one. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll live for long, so I decided to do whatever I liked until I died.&#xA;I tried browsing the internet and found out that it was not interesting. Just to be sure, I never had an instagram account or anything, and the only time I had a facebook account was nearly a decade ago, which I used to play some browser games once a month or so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
