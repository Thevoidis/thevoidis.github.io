	<h3>Summary</h3>				
					I like to write stories. But sometimes, I am curious as to how many people actually read them. So for a brief moment, I thought- &ldquo;how about I find out how many people read my stories ?&rdquo; But to do so, I had to create some js tracker on my site (maybe github provides one by default, I don&rsquo;t know), but wouldn&rsquo;t that be stalking ? Why is it my business to know how many people visited my site.

				<h2>The Reason for Creating Another Blog</h2>

	<h3>Summary</h3>				
					Just to get this out of the picture. I already have another site
However, that one was meant to be a personal portfolio of sorts. But now I realize that I have no use of a personal portfolio. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to get a job anyway, so why bother with one. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll live for long, so I decided to do whatever I liked until I died.
