  <h1>Dear Kafka - Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="bloginfo">

    <h2 id="kyton">Kyton</h2>
<p>The eyes were always there.
Not real eyes, not reflections in a rain-slicked window or the passing glance of a stranger on the street.
These were heavier.
They pressed against the inside of his skull, a phantom weight behind his own gaze.
Freedom? Freedom was a word for people who didn&rsquo;t carry their own courtroom inside their head.</p>
<p>Kyton was a man who could disappear any day. No one would notice or care.
Perhaps the owners of his rented office would worry a bit about them not recieving payment after he is gone.
Perhaps his neighbours will complain about the unkept house after he is gone.
No one else would actually care.</p>
<p>Kyton heard his personal courtroom in silence.
That was how it was, his own panel of judges.
Every day , there was a different panel.
Sometimes his parents , his old teachers, his schoolmates, some police officers, some politicians, anyone.
Anyone whom he met would show up in his head uninvited.
He wondered if he should be charging rent for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it was every time he sat in his office. But it was early morning. He could not go home now.
If he did , he would not get any clients. Not that he ever did, but there wouldn&rsquo;t be a chance at all if he went home.
What did he do to deserve this ?
Who was to blame for him being like this ?
Maybe himself ? But he had bankrupted himself by becoming a psychologist to fix himself, and that didn&rsquo;t work.
Now he could claim to be doubly unemployed- both as a private investigator and as a psychologist.
He wasn&rsquo;t getting clients from either profession.
And he was already a middle aged man now- he had turned thirty five a few months prior.
No significant other. No stable source of income. Bad mental health. A broken home.
The hallmark of a failure. He didn&rsquo;t even have distant family members he could talk to.
All of them were dead. His parents. His first relatives.
And he never bothered starting one of his own.
Not that he could.
He himself did not know which words were his and which were from the judges in his head.
When would he be free of this torment ?</p>
<p>Perhaps he should read something. Maybe that would help.
He had not yet cancelled the newspapers to his office.
Perhaps he should do it soon. There is nothing more than propoganda in it anyway.
But he took the paper anyway.
Glancing over the articles, he sighed.
So much focus on murders ? Maybe that caught the people&rsquo;s attention ?</p>
