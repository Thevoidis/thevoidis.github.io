      <description>Foreword So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a story. Yes , a story, I get it. Very unlike me. But I have actually written a lot of stories in school. Most of them got lost, and those that are left are better left untold. But I realized something about them. I hate the whole &amp;lsquo;make it an art&amp;rsquo; thing. I do not like decorating a story with words that don&amp;rsquo;t belong there.</description>

      <description>Kyton The eyes were always there. Not real eyes, not reflections in a rain-slicked window or the passing glance of a stranger on the street. These were heavier. They pressed against the inside of his skull, a phantom weight behind his own gaze. Freedom? Freedom was a word for people who didn&amp;rsquo;t carry their own courtroom inside their head.&#xA;Kyton was a man who could disappear any day. No one would notice or care.</description>
