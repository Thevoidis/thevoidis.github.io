      <description>Kyton The eyes were always there. Not real eyes, not reflections in a rain-slicked window or the passing glance of a stranger on the street. These were heavier. They pressed against the inside of his skull, a phantom weight behind his own gaze. Freedom? Freedom was a word for people who didn&amp;rsquo;t carry their own courtroom inside their head.&#xA;Kyton was a man who could disappear any day. No one would notice or care.</description>
