<p>Kyton Nixot is a detectice/psychologist who wonders why he still continues to live on.

  Foreword So I&rsquo;ve decided to write a story. Yes , a story, I get it. Very unlike me. But I have actually written a lot of stories in school. Most of them got lost, and those that are left are better left untold. But I realized something about them. I hate the whole &lsquo;make it an art&rsquo; thing. I do not like decorating a story with words that don&rsquo;t belong there.

  Kyton The eyes were always there. Not real eyes, not reflections in a rain-slicked window or the passing glance of a stranger on the street. These were heavier. They pressed against the inside of his skull, a phantom weight behind his own gaze. Freedom? Freedom was a word for people who didn&rsquo;t carry their own courtroom inside their head.
Kyton was a man who could disappear any day. No one would notice or care.
