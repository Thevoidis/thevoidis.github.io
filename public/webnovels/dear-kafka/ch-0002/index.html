  <title>Dear Kafka - Chapter 2</title>
  <h1>Dear Kafka - Chapter 2</h1>

<div class="bloginfo">

    <h1 id="kyton">Kyton</h1>
<p>A dark room.
It stretches as far as the eye can see.
In the centre of it, a chair. The chair seems to be lit up by a spotlight from a ceiling that seems to high to fathom.
Kyton slowly approaches the chair with a sigh.
As if on cue, a desk fades into view a few feet in front of him.
The desk rises higher than his height , and a small platform appears beneath the desk.
Kyton didn&rsquo;t even consider leaving. He knew what would come next.
Wooden bars started to raise from the dark floor around Kyton.
Soon, he was in a cage.
At least he had a chair.
Kyton sits on the chair, waiting for the judges.
He takes in a breath, then another one. He kept taking in breaths , never exhaling.
Sure, that was possible.</p>
<p>His judges start appearing behind the desk.
They seem to have trouble deciding who would form tonight&rsquo;s panel, as many of them appeared and disappeared at will.
All of them were bringing up charges against Kyton, but they seemed to be unsure of which trial to conduct at the moment.
Kyton had too many charges, it seems.
Kyton pulled out the imaginary book he was writing from his pocket.
Every time he opens it, the book starts empty, but he continues in the book where he left off.
The book had a seal that read &ldquo;How to not care a damn and disappoint your parents anyway&rdquo;
As Kyton was wondering what to write down this time, the judges seemed to have made up their mind.</p>
