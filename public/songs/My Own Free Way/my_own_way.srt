1
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:19,567
Woke up to rules that I never made,
Trapped in a life where dreams would fade.\⁠h

2
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:29,597
Counting the days in a hollow race,
Running so fast but stuck in place.

3
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:37,887
They say, "Just follow, don’t ask why,"
But I see the world and I wonder why—\⁠h

4
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:47,247
If living means to just obey,
Then when do I get my say?

5
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:56,767
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.\⁠h

6
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:16,967
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

7
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:26,847
I colored inside the lines they drew,
Hiding the shades of a life I knew.\⁠h

8
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:35,567
They called it wisdom, they called it fate,
But all I felt was a heavy weight.

9
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:45,687
They say, "Be perfect, don’t fall behind,"
But I’ve got a voice and I’ve got a mind.\⁠h

10
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:58,047
If life’s a song, then I won’t mime,
I’ll write my own, in my own time.

11
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:07,647
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.\⁠h

12
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:18,527
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

13
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:28,007
I don’t want regrets to hold me down,
No more fear, no more doubt.\⁠h

14
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:46,407
If I must fall, then let me fly,
At least I’ll know I tried.

15
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:56,087
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.\⁠h

16
00:02:56,087 --> 00:03:07,047
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

17
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:14,727
Let me live before goodbye…
