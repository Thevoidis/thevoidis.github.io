1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,480
In this vast universe
Among the many stars\h

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,120
In a single vast blue planet\h

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:21,000
My small feelings of love would reach
to that tiny island where you are

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
Time had passed since I met you\h

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,960
And the letters adorning our\h
feelings are also increasing\h

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:43,160
Someday, they will echo unnoticed in our hearts
At times violently, at times sorrowfully

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:54,160
They will echo faraway, into the far-off distance
This tender song will change the world

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,840
Look now
The person who you cherish\h

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,400
Is right beside you
I wish\h

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:11,160
for this to reach just you
Resonate, my song of love\h

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,800
Look now...
Resound, my song of love

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,040
You come to realise,\h

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,600
that even when the two of\h
us should walk a dark road\h

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,640
The moon would illuminate our days
Never letting go of your hand I've clasped\h

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,760
Our feelings are strong
and we vow it's for all eternity\h

16
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,400
In the depths of eternity
I will surely say the exact same words\h

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,840
with my feelings still the same
But those words will never cease\h

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,440
they will turn into tears
Then to joy\h

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,040
Unable to speak
I'll just embrace you

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,760
Look now
The person who you cherish\h

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,200
Is right beside you
I wish\h

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:16,080
for this to reach just you
Resonate, my song of love\h

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,280
Look now...
Resound, my song of love

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:33,360
If it's a dream don't wake me up
If it's a dream don't wake me up\h

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
The time I've spent with you\h

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:45,600
Shall become a star
shining eternally

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,360
Look now
The person who you cherish\h

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,880
is right besides you
I wish\h

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,840
for this to reach just you
Oh resound, my song of love\h

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,240
Look now\h

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,600
the person who you cherish
Is right beside you\h

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,200
I wish
for this to reach just you\h

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:29,760
Resonate, my song of love
Look now...\h

34
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Look now!
Resound, my song of love
