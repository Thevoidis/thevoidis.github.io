00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.480
In this vast universe
Among the many stars&nbsp;

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.120
In a single vast blue planet&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:21.000
My small feelings of love would reach
to that tiny island where you are

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.400
Time had passed since I met you&nbsp;

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.960
And the letters adorning our&nbsp;
feelings are also increasing&nbsp;

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:43.160
Someday, they will echo unnoticed in our hearts
At times violently, at times sorrowfully

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:54.160
They will echo faraway, into the far-off distance
This tender song will change the world

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.840
Look now
The person who you cherish&nbsp;

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.400
Is right beside you
I wish&nbsp;

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.160
for this to reach just you
Resonate, my song of love&nbsp;

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.800
Look now...
Resound, my song of love

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.040
You come to realise,&nbsp;

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.600
that even when the two of&nbsp;
us should walk a dark road&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.640
The moon would illuminate our days
Never letting go of your hand I've clasped&nbsp;

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.760
Our feelings are strong
and we vow it's for all eternity&nbsp;

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.400
In the depths of eternity
I will surely say the exact same words&nbsp;

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.840
with my feelings still the same
But those words will never cease&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.440
they will turn into tears
Then to joy&nbsp;

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.040
Unable to speak
I'll just embrace you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.760
Look now
The person who you cherish&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.200
Is right beside you
I wish&nbsp;

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.080
for this to reach just you
Resonate, my song of love&nbsp;

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.280
Look now...
Resound, my song of love

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:33.360
If it's a dream don't wake me up
If it's a dream don't wake me up&nbsp;

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.680
The time I've spent with you&nbsp;

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:45.600
Shall become a star
shining eternally

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.360
Look now
The person who you cherish&nbsp;

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.880
is right besides you
I wish&nbsp;

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.840
for this to reach just you
Oh resound, my song of love&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.240
Look now&nbsp;

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.600
the person who you cherish
Is right beside you&nbsp;

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.200
I wish
for this to reach just you&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:29.760
Resonate, my song of love
Look now...&nbsp;

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:46.120
Look now!
Resound, my song of love
