00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.606
 No voice was given to the wind,
Yet still, it calls your name.
 

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:35.417
 No trace was left upon the earth,
Yet still, I know you came.

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:43.912
Like whispers lost in falling rain,
Like footprints washed away,

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:53.024
  The world may never see nor know,
But I remain, I stay.

00:00:53.024 --> 00:01:01.625
If the sky should break in sorrow,
If the dawn forgets to rise,

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:10.073
Still, I’d walk beyond tomorrow,
Still, I’d chase the fading light.

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:18.958
Even if the world should lose me,
Even if my voice should cease,

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:27.711
Know that somewhere, in the silence,
I will sing you back to peace.

00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:35.883
No shadow lingers in the dark,
Yet still, I feel you near.

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:45.441
No words were carved upon my heart,
Yet still, the meaning’s clear.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:53.794
A promise made without a sound,
A vow the stars won’t hear,

00:01:53.794 --> 00:02:02.790
Though time may take its toll on all,
This bond won’t disappear.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.097
If the sky should break in sorrow,
If the dawn forgets to rise,

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:19.854
Still, I’d walk beyond tomorrow,
Still, I’d chase the fading light.
 

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:28.680
Even if the world should lose me,
Even if my voice should cease,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.482
Know that somewhere, in the silence,
I will sing you back to peace.

00:02:37.482 --> 00:02:45.817
I won’t ask for you to hear me,
I won’t hope for you to see.

00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:55.203
Love need not be known or spoken,
For it lives eternally.
