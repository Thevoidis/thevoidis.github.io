00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.720
Softly falls the evening’s&nbsp;
glow, the day becomes a sigh,&nbsp;

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.200
With footsteps worn on paths&nbsp;
I know, beneath a patient sky.&nbsp;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.400
The wind brings echoes, faint and&nbsp;
warm, from places far and near,&nbsp;

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:40.880
A fleeting shape, a distant&nbsp;
name—so close, and yet unclear.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.200
The hearthlight flickers—stories&nbsp;
weave, of longing and release,&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.960
Of loves that slipped like morning&nbsp;
dew, yet left the heart at peace.&nbsp;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.440
A single petal, drifting&nbsp;
down, unfolds a hidden thread—&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:22.040
A voice I knew, a vow unsaid,&nbsp;
from dreams I thought had fled.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.200
Ciel—the dawn, the gentle rain,&nbsp;
the breath between the trees—&nbsp;

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.000
She taught me how the world could&nbsp;
sing through whispers on the breeze.&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.600
In childhood’s spring, she touched&nbsp;
my soul, then faded with the tide—&nbsp;

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.640
But every path I’ve walked since&nbsp;
then has kept her by my side.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.240
No need to chase, no need to&nbsp;
bind—what’s lost returns in time.&nbsp;

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.760
The river knows, the mountains&nbsp;
keep, what fate makes hers and mine.&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.920
I’ve sought no crown, nor fought&nbsp;
the sky—just followed nature’s flow—&nbsp;

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:18.760
And through the stillness of my&nbsp;
heart, I found what I let go.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:29.840
The wind may scatter leaves afar—
Yet every leaf becomes a star—&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:59.040
No distance, time, or world above
Can break the bond of silent love.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.880
So let her be where she must go—
The stream will meet the sea—&nbsp;

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.360
And if the sky returns her name,
She’ll find her way to me.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.880
No grasping hands, no cries, no fight—
Just faith that darkness leads to light—&nbsp;

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:29.760
For what is meant will always stay—
A blossom borne upon the way.
