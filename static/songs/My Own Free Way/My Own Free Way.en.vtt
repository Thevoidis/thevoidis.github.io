00:10.087 --> 00:19.567
Woke up to rules that I never made,
Trapped in a life where dreams would fade.

00:19.567 --> 00:29.597
Counting the days in a hollow race,
Running so fast but stuck in place.

00:29.597 --> 00:37.887
They say, "Just follow, don’t ask why,"
But I see the world and I wonder why—

00:37.887 --> 00:47.247
If living means to just obey,
Then when do I get my say?

00:47.247 --> 00:56.767
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.

00:56.767 --> 01:16.967
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

01:16.967 --> 01:26.847
I colored inside the lines they drew,
Hiding the shades of a life I knew.

01:26.847 --> 01:35.567
They called it wisdom, they called it fate,
But all I felt was a heavy weight.

01:35.567 --> 01:45.687
They say, "Be perfect, don’t fall behind,"
But I’ve got a voice and I’ve got a mind.

01:45.687 --> 01:58.047
If life’s a song, then I won’t mime,
I’ll write my own, in my own time.

01:58.047 --> 02:07.647
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.

02:07.647 --> 02:18.527
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

02:18.527 --> 02:28.007
I don’t want regrets to hold me down,
No more fear, no more doubt.

02:28.007 --> 02:46.407
If I must fall, then let me fly,
At least I’ll know I tried.

02:46.407 --> 02:56.087
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.

02:56.087 --> 03:07.047
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

03:07.047 --> 03:14.727
Let me live before goodbye…
