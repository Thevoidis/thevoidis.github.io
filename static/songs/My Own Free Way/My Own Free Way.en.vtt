00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:19.560
Woke up to rules that I never made,
Trapped in a life where dreams would fade.&nbsp;

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:29.590
Counting the days in a hollow race,
Running so fast but stuck in place.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:37.880
They say, "Just follow, don’t ask why,"
But I see the world and I wonder why—&nbsp;

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:47.240
If living means to just obey,
Then when do I get my say?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:56.760
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.&nbsp;

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:16.960
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:26.840
I colored inside the lines they drew,
Hiding the shades of a life I knew.&nbsp;

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:35.560
They called it wisdom, they called it fate,
But all I felt was a heavy weight.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:45.680
They say, "Be perfect, don’t fall behind,"
But I’ve got a voice and I’ve got a mind.&nbsp;

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:58.040
If life’s a song, then I won’t mime,
I’ll write my own, in my own time.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:07.640
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.&nbsp;

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:18.520
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:28.000
I don’t want regrets to hold me down,
No more fear, no more doubt.&nbsp;

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:46.400
If I must fall, then let me fly,
At least I’ll know I tried.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:56.080
Give me some air, give me some light,
Let me feel the world outside.&nbsp;

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:07.040
One more chance, one more day,
Let me live in my own way.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.720
Let me live before goodbye…
