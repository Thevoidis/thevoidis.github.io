00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.500
In the vast expanse of night, where stars shine bright

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.100
An angel's wings unfurl, her heart takes flight.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.200
Guided by the moonbeams, she sings a lullaby,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.800
To soothe the world beneath the velvet sky.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.400
Oh, let the wisdom flow, like a river wide,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.000
Through hearts and minds it gently will abide.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.600
In every step we take, in every breath we draw,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.200
The light of knowledge shall forever glow.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.800
She dances on the winds that whisper secrets old,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.400
Her voice a symphony that time cannot unfold.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.000
With grace and love, she spreads her heavenly glow,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.100
Bringing peace and understanding wherever she may go.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.700
A bridge between the realms, where dreams and truth entwine,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.300
She guides her master through the labyrinthine design.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.900
Together they ascend, their spirits intertwined,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.500
To reach the pinnacle of wisdom and divine.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.100
Oh, let the wisdom flow, like a river wide,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.700
Through hearts and minds it gently will abide.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.300
In every step we take, in every breath we draw,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.900
The light of knowledge shall forever glow.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.500
And when the dawn breaks, casting shadows away,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.100
Their journey ends, yet their path remains to stray.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.700
For wisdom is eternal, it never fades or dies,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.300
It lives within us, forever ties.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.900
So let us walk this path, side by side, my dear,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.500
Embracing knowledge, shedding all our fear.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.100
For in your heart, I'll always be,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.700
Your guide, your friend, your incarnate wisdom, Ciel.
