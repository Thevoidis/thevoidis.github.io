<blockquote>
<p>There are rivers that carve mountains, shaping the land over
centuries. And then there are rivers that carry the sky—holding
reflections of the heavens upon their surface, never grasping, never
keeping, only flowing onward.</p>
<p>I have lived like such a river.</p>
<p>Once, in a childhood half-forgotten, I reached for the sky. I spoke
with an angel who whispered of wisdom hidden in the rustling leaves and
the hush of the wind. But like all rivers, I kept moving, leaving those
memories behind.</p>
<p>Years passed. Hands calloused, roads walked, laughter shared, and
still, I thought myself at peace. Until one day, a voice in the wind
called a name I had long buried.</p>
<p>Ciel.</p>
<p>It was then that I realized—the sky had never left me. I had only
forgotten to look.</p>

<h1 id="the-river-that-carries-the-sky">The River That Carries the
Sky</h1>
<p>I was born in a quiet village, the kind where days passed in the
rhythm of seasons, where the scent of fresh bread and tilled earth
filled the air. My parents were simple folk—my father, a woodcutter, my
mother, a weaver. They worked hard and laughed often, teaching me the
value of a steady hand and a kind word.</p>
<p>As a child, I was restless. The village felt small, the paths too
well-trodden, the sky always just out of reach. I spent my days
wandering the hills, chasing the wind as if I could catch it in my
hands.</p>
<p>One autumn afternoon, when the air was crisp and the scent of fallen
leaves filled my lungs, I ventured deeper into the woods than ever
before. The trees stood taller here, their canopies thick, filtering
sunlight into golden patches on the moss-covered ground. The world felt
different—quieter, as though it were holding its breath.</p>
<p>I followed the sound of running water, my small hands brushing
against the rough bark of ancient oaks, until I reached a clearing. A
stream cut through the land, its surface shimmering with the reflection
of the sky. And there, on the other side, stood a girl unlike any I had
ever seen.</p>
<p>She was dressed in white, her deep blue hair flowing like the river
itself, her feet bare against the soft earth. She knelt beside the
stream, dipping her hands into the water, and for a moment, she seemed
part of the forest itself—something ageless and untouchable.</p>
<p>I stepped forward, twigs snapping beneath my feet. She lifted her
head. Her eyes met mine—crimson, like embers in the twilight.</p>
<p>“You’re lost,” she said, her voice carrying across the water, light
as the breeze.</p>
<p>“I’m not lost,” I replied, though I wasn’t sure if it was true. “Who
are you?”</p>
<p>She tilted her head, as if considering the question. “I am no one,
and I am everyone. I am the voice in the wind, the whisper in the
leaves. But you can call me Ciel.”</p>
<p>I frowned, not understanding her words. “That’s a strange name.”</p>
<p>She smiled, and it was the kind of smile that made the world feel
lighter. “Perhaps. But names are only what we make of them.”</p>
<p>Something about her fascinated me, though I couldn’t explain why. I
wanted to ask more, to understand who she was, but before I could, she
stood up, stepping into the stream. The water barely rippled around her
feet.</p>
<p>“Come,” she said, holding out her hand. “If you wish to see the world
as I do, follow me.”</p>
<p>And without thinking, without questioning, I did.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was a point in my life which would decide my fate for
years to come.</p>
<p>As I followed her across the stream, I noticed an ancient tree
standing at the edge of the clearing. Its bark was cracked and peeling,
its branches brittle, stretching toward the sky like the fingers of a
dying man. Something about it made me uneasy—it looked as though it had
given up long ago.</p>
<p>She stopped beside it and placed a hand against its rough trunk.
“Even what seems lifeless still listens,” she murmured. “Everything has
a voice, if you are willing to hear it.”</p>
<p>I frowned. “But this tree is dead.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, her deep blue hair catching the sunlight. Then
she closed her eyes, and the air around us stilled. It was as if the
forest itself was holding its breath. A hush passed through the
leaves—not a breeze, but something deeper, something I could feel in my
bones.</p>
<p>Then, before my eyes, the tree began to change. The deep cracks in
its bark smoothed over, as though time itself was reversing. Tiny buds
appeared along its branches, unfurling into fresh green leaves. A single
flower bloomed at the highest point, pale and delicate, swaying in the
unseen current of Ciel’s will.</p>
<p>I took a step back, my breath caught in my throat. “How did
you…?”</p>
<p>She turned to me, crimson eyes warm with something I couldn’t quite
name. “It was always alive,” she said softly. “It was only waiting to be
seen.”</p>
<p>I barely had time to process what I had witnessed before she moved
again, leading me deeper into the woods. She stopped by a pool of water,
its surface smooth as glass, reflecting the golden hues of the setting
sun. Ciel knelt beside it and traced her fingers along the water. The
reflection shimmered, rippling outward, and in an instant, I saw
something impossible. The image of the sky changed, revealing stars
twinkling against a night untouched by the sun. It was as if she had
pulled the future into the present, showing me the heavens before their
time had come.</p>
<p>I gasped. “Is this magic?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “It is only the truth of what is yet to be. The
world carries time in its own way.”</p>
<p>I had no words, only wonder.</p>
<p>We continued on, the forest darkening around us, and soon, we reached
a quiet clearing. Fireflies danced in the air, their lights blinking in
slow rhythms, like the gentle heartbeat of the night itself. Ciel raised
a hand, and the lights gathered around her, swirling like tiny stars
pulled into an unseen current. They spiraled and moved in patterns too
intricate for me to understand, and for a moment, the night itself
seemed to hum with life.</p>
<p>I turned to Ciel, my voice barely above a whisper. “Who are you
really?”</p>
<p>She only smiled.</p>
<p>By then, the sky had darkened completely, and I realized with a
sinking feeling that I didn’t know the way home. The trees looked
unfamiliar, the path I had taken now hidden in the shadows. My chest
tightened. I had wandered too far.</p>
<p>Ciel must have noticed my unease because she exhaled softly, a breath
lighter than the wind itself. It drifted forward, weaving through the
trees like an unseen guide. “Follow it,” she said. “It will take you
home.”</p>
<p>I hesitated, glancing back at her. “Will I see you again?”</p>
<p>Her crimson eyes softened. “The wind always returns to those who
listen.”</p>
<p>I stepped forward, following the invisible current of air as it
whispered through the trees. The moment I turned back, Ciel was gone, as
if she had never been there at all.</p>
<p>But the fireflies still danced, and the tree she had touched still
bloomed.</p>
<p>And I knew, somehow, that she was real.</p>
<p>For many days, it went on like this. Each morning, I would venture
into the woods, and there she would be—Ciel, with her deep blue hair and
crimson eyes, waiting with a gentle smile. Every day, she would show me
something new. One day, she taught me how to listen to the whispers of
the wind, and another, she revealed the way leaves danced in unseen
patterns. She spoke of harmony, of patience, of the world’s silent
wisdom hidden in plain sight.</p>
<p>Without realizing it myself, I began to change. My once restless mind
grew calm, my eager heart found stillness. I found myself walking
slower, observing more, thinking less of desires and more of
balance.</p>
<p>But all things must change. One day, my parents told me that we were
leaving the village. My father had found better work elsewhere, and
though I was still young, I understood that this was something beyond my
control. The night before we left, I ran to the woods one last time,
heart pounding with the weight of an unspoken farewell.</p>
<p>Ciel was there, as if she had always known. She did not ask why my
steps were hurried or why my breath came short. She simply smiled, the
same serene expression I had come to treasure. I told her everything—how
we were leaving, how I did not know when I would return. My voice
wavered as I promised her that I would come back one day.</p>
<p>She did not try to stop me. Instead, she placed a hand on my head, as
she had done so many times before, and whispered, “Then I will
wait.”</p>
<p>And so I left, glancing back at the forest as long as I could, hoping
to catch one last glimpse of her between the trees. But when I blinked,
she was gone, like a breath of wind dissolving into the night.</p>
<p>Years passed, and I grew into a young man. I lived simply, never
desiring wealth or status. My parents passed away when I was still
coming of age, leaving me to fend for myself. I took on whatever work I
could find—chopping wood, mending roofs, carrying water—never asking for
more than what was needed to survive. I wore the same tattered robes,
ate whatever I could forage from the forest, and slept beneath the
stars.</p>
<p>People began to notice me, though I never sought their attention.
They came with their burdens—broken tools, broken hearts, broken hopes.
I listened, offered what little help I could, and somehow, their
problems faded away. Sometimes it was through words, sometimes through
actions, and sometimes it was simply that, in speaking to me, they found
the answers themselves.</p>
<p>They tried to reward me, but I had no need for gold or gifts. My joy
was in the quiet, in the rhythm of life as it unfolded naturally. And
so, they left their offerings anyway—a loaf of bread, a warm cloak, a
place to rest when the nights grew cold. It was not much, but it was
enough.</p>
<p>For some reason , many people came to be , seeking , in their words,
‘the simple man who solved their problems in incomprehensible ways’. And
though I asked for nothing, they kept coming, as if drawn by something
even I did not understand</p>
<p>One day, as I wandered through a small town, the sharp sound of an
argument caught my ear. I turned to see a young woman, her clothes worn
and patched, standing before a merchant’s stall. Her voice was firm, but
there was a roughness to it, the kind that came from too many days of
hunger and too many nights spent under the open sky.</p>
<p>“That’s twice the price it was yesterday,” she said, arms crossed.
“You’re cheating me.”</p>
<p>The merchant scoffed. “Prices change. If you can’t pay, move
along.”</p>
<p>I watched as her fingers curled into fists, her pride warring with
her desperation. She didn’t want to beg, but she had little choice.
Before she could speak again, I stepped forward and placed the last
piece of bread I carried onto the stall.</p>
<p>“Take it,” I said simply.</p>
<p>She turned to me, eyes narrowing. “Why?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “Because you’re hungry.”</p>
<p>She hesitated, then snatched the bread from the stall. She ate
quickly, without another word, and when she finished, she glanced at me
once more before disappearing into the crowd.</p>
<p>I thought that would be the last I saw of her.</p>
<p>But fate had other plans.</p>
<p>A few days later, as I worked to mend a broken cartwheel for an old
farmer, I felt a gaze on me. I turned and found her sitting beneath a
tree, arms folded, watching me in silence.</p>
<p>When I finished my work, she finally spoke. “You helped me once.
Why?”</p>
<p>I wiped my hands on my robe. “Because you were hungry,” I
repeated.</p>
<p>She scoffed. “People don’t help others for nothing.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” I said, “but I need nothing, so I ask for nothing.”</p>
<p>She frowned, as if searching for a catch, some hidden trick. When she
found none, she let out a short breath and looked away. “Neia.”</p>
<p>I tilted my head.</p>
<p>“That’s my name,” she muttered.</p>
<p>I nodded. “Rimuru.”</p>
<p>And with that, a new path unfolded before me.</p>
<p>Neia didn’t leave after that. At first, she kept her distance,
watching me from afar as I worked. Some days, she would appear as I
swept the steps of a temple or helped a villager lift a heavy load.
Other days, she trailed behind as I walked the roads, though she never
spoke much.</p>
<p>She was cautious, like a stray animal testing whether a hand was
meant to feed or to strike.</p>
<p>I let her be.</p>
<p>Then, one evening, as I sat beneath an old tree, sipping water from a
wooden cup, she finally sat beside me.</p>
<p>“You really don’t ask for anything, do you?”</p>
<p>I glanced at her. The setting sun cast an orange glow on her face,
highlighting the sharpness in her eyes—eyes that had seen too much of
the world’s cruelty.</p>
<p>“I have what I need,” I said simply.</p>
<p>She pulled her knees to her chest. “That’s stupid.”</p>
<p>I smiled. “Perhaps.”</p>
<p>For a while, we sat in silence. The breeze carried the scent of warm
earth, and the distant chatter of villagers filled the spaces between
our words.</p>
<p>She lingered near the places I worked, always with a skeptical look
on her face. She didn’t ask for help again, but she didn’t seem to trust
me either. It was as if she were waiting for me to reveal some hidden
motive, some price for my kindness that I had yet to name.</p>
<p>One evening, as I sat by the river washing my hands, she finally
spoke again.</p>
<p>“You live like a beggar,” she said, sitting down a few feet away. “No
home, no money, no future. What’s the point?”</p>
<p>I cupped a handful of water and let it slip through my fingers. “A
river does not ask where it flows. It simply moves with the land.”</p>
<p>She clicked her tongue. “That doesn’t answer anything.”</p>
<p>I smiled. “Doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>She scoffed and leaned back on her elbows, looking up at the sky.
“You know, I used to think people like you didn’t exist. The ones who
help without expecting anything back. In my world, everyone takes and
takes, and if you don’t take first, you’re left with nothing.”</p>
<p>I didn’t ask about her world. If she wanted me to know, she would
tell me in her own time.</p>
<p>Instead, I simply said, “Do you still believe that?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer. But she kept coming back.</p>
<p>One evening, as we sat beneath an old willow tree, Neia stared into
the distance, her expression unreadable. The sky was burning with the
colors of dusk, but her eyes were fixed on something far away—something
I couldn’t see.</p>
<p>“I had a brother once,” she said suddenly, her voice quiet but
steady. “His name was Ikor. He was always laughing, always dreaming. He
wanted to be a knight, you know? Said he’d wear shining armor and fight
for justice. But we were peasants. Justice doesn’t put food on the
table.”</p>
<p>She picked up a small stone and rolled it between her fingers. “The
war came, and they needed bodies more than they needed knights. The
lords went through the villages and took every able-bodied boy. We had
no say in it. One morning, he was my brother, sparring with a wooden
sword in the backyard. By nightfall, he was a soldier.”</p>
<p>She tossed the stone into the grass. “We got one letter from him.
One. He wrote that he was fine, that he missed home, that he would
return soon. I didn’t believe a word of it.”</p>
<p>Her hands curled into fists. “The second letter wasn’t from him. It
was from his captain. They sent his things back—what little he had. A
rusted dagger. A half-burned map. A lock of our mother’s hair. I don’t
even know where he was buried.”</p>
<p>She exhaled sharply, as if trying to push something out of her chest.
“Then my sister. Elthea. She was the beautiful one. The smart one. The
one who could’ve married someone rich, if we weren’t drowning in debt.
My parents—” She stopped, then started again. “My parents sold her to
some merchant from the city. Said he’d take care of her, give her a
better life. But we both knew the truth. He wasn’t looking for a
wife.”</p>
<p>Neia hugged her knees, her voice growing rough. “I stayed as long as
I could after that, but what was left for me? A brother in the dirt, a
sister in chains, parents who had long since stopped looking me in the
eye?” She let out a small, humorless laugh. “So I ran. I don’t even know
if they cared. Maybe they were relieved—one less mouth to feed.”</p>
<p>Silence stretched between us, filled only by the whisper of the wind
through the trees. I didn’t say anything. There was nothing to say that
could take that pain away.</p>
<p>After a long while, she turned to me, searching my face as if
expecting something—pity, maybe. Judgment. But I only met her gaze and
said, “You survived.”</p>
<p>She let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. “Yeah. I
did.”</p>
<p>And for the first time, she looked at me not with skepticism, but
with something closer to understanding. She laughed bitterly when she
spoke of it. “It’s funny,” she said once. “I hated the life I left
behind, but at least I understood it. But this…” She gestured vaguely at
me, at the simple way I lived. “This makes no sense.”</p>
<p>“Does it need to?” I asked.</p>
<p>She was quiet for a long time. Then, she sighed. “Maybe not.”</p>
<p>And so, she stayed. Not because she had nowhere else to go—though
that may have been part of it—but because she wanted to understand.</p>
<p>One afternoon, as the sun cast long golden rays through the forest, I
was splitting logs behind the village. The rhythmic crack of wood
breaking apart filled the air, mingling with the rustling of leaves in
the soft breeze. I wiped the sweat from my brow and reached for another
log when—</p>
<p>A flicker of blue.</p>
<p>Just beyond the trees, barely visible between the shifting
branches.</p>
<p>I froze, axe still in hand. The color danced between the leaves,
swaying like strands of silk caught in the wind. My heart skipped a
beat. It was strange—no one in the village had hair that shade. And yet,
something about it tugged at my memory, a feeling both distant and
familiar.</p>
<p>Before I realized it, my feet were moving. I stepped past the
treeline, following the flash of blue deeper into the woods. The ground
was soft beneath my steps, the air thick with the scent of earth and
moss. The figure was always just ahead, slipping past my vision the
moment I thought I had caught up.</p>
<p>Then, nothing.</p>
<p>I found myself standing in a quiet clearing, surrounded by the soft
hush of trees. The blue had vanished, leaving only the whispering wind
behind. I turned in slow circles, searching, but there was nothing—no
footprints, no broken twigs, nothing to prove that I had seen anything
at all.</p>
<p>Had I imagined it?</p>
<p>The thought unsettled me. I stood there for a long while before
finally turning back. But the feeling stayed with me, gnawing at the
edges of my mind like an unfinished melody.</p>
<p>For days, it lingered. I would catch myself lost in thought, trying
to chase a memory that remained just out of reach. Where had I seen that
blue before? Why did it stir something deep within me, something I could
not name?</p>
<p>I must have been distracted more than I realized because one evening,
as I sat sharpening a dull knife, Neia plopped down beside me with a
frown.</p>
<p>“You’ve been weird lately.” She propped her chin on her hand, eyes
narrowing. “You keep staring off into space like you’re seeing ghosts or
something.”</p>
<p>I blinked, pulled from my thoughts. “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Liar.” She flicked a small twig at me. “Something’s on your mind.
What is it?”</p>
<p>I hesitated, turning the knife in my hands. Would she think I was
losing my mind? That I was chasing shadows in the woods for no
reason?</p>
<p>But Neia had always been stubborn. She wouldn’t let it go until I
answered.</p>
<p>“…I saw something in the forest the other day,” I admitted finally.
“Something that felt… familiar.”</p>
<p>Neia tilted her head. “What kind of something?”</p>
<p>I exhaled, searching for the right words. “A glimpse of blue. Like
flowing hair.”</p>
<p>She raised a brow. “And you’re sure it wasn’t just a trick of the
light?”</p>
<p>“Maybe.” I wasn’t sure at all.</p>
<p>She watched me for a moment before leaning back on her elbows. “Well,
if you figure it out, let me know. You’re acting like a man who just saw
a ghost.”</p>
<p>I forced a chuckle. “Maybe I did.”</p>
<p>But deep down, I knew—this was no mere trick of the light. Something,
or someone, was waiting for me to remember.</p>
<p>For days, the image of flowing blue hair haunted my thoughts. Every
time I closed my eyes, I could see it swaying between the trees, just
beyond my reach. It felt like a whisper from my past, a memory buried so
deep that I couldn’t quite grasp it.</p>
<p>One evening, as I sat by the river, watching the current carry away
scattered leaves, a realization struck me.</p>
<p>My old village.</p>
<p>The thought sent a strange shiver through me. The village where I was
born—the one I left as a child. Could the vision have something to do
with that place? Had I once seen something, or someone, there who bore
the same blue as the figure in the forest?</p>
<p>But there was a problem.</p>
<p>I had been too young when we moved. I barely remembered its name, let
alone where it was. My parents had never spoken of it after we left, and
I had never thought to ask. Now, as the past beckoned me, I realized I
had no way of returning to a place I could not name.</p>
<p>Still, I couldn’t ignore this feeling.</p>
<p>I needed to find my village.</p>
<h3 id="section"></h3>
<p>The town I lived in now—Alba’s Hollow—was not unkind to me. It had
given me shelter, even if I had never truly belonged. But it was not my
home.</p>
<p>The trouble was, I had no money for travel. I owned nothing of value
except the small cabin I had built with my own hands, nestled at the
edge of the forest. It wasn’t much—just a wooden structure with a single
room and a hearth, the walls patched with whatever materials I could
scavenge. But it had been enough for me.</p>
<p>And so, with a quiet heart, I sold it.</p>
<p>A poet passing through Alba’s Hollow had long admired the tranquility
of my home. He wished for a retreat, a place where he could write in
solitude. When I told him he could have the cabin, he eagerly accepted,
paying me a modest sum in exchange. It was more money than I had ever
owned.</p>
<p>But it did not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>“You did WHAT?”</p>
<p>Neia’s voice nearly echoed through the entire town square. A few
heads turned, and I had to resist the urge to step back.</p>
<p>“I sold my cabin,” I repeated, as if saying it again might make it
sound less shocking to her.</p>
<p>She gaped at me, utterly bewildered. “Your only house? The one you
lived in?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She threw her hands up. “Why would you do that?! Where are you even
going to stay?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “Wherever I need to.”</p>
<p>“That’s not an answer!” She ran a hand through her hair, clearly
trying to keep herself from knocking some sense into me. “You—You can’t
just throw your home away like that! Where are you even planning to
go?”</p>
<p>“To find my old village.”</p>
<p>Neia stopped mid-rant, blinking. “…What?”</p>
<p>I exhaled. “I think the thing I saw in the forest is connected to
where I was born. I don’t know its name or its location, but I need to
find it.”</p>
<p>Her expression shifted, the sharpness fading into something more
uncertain. “But… why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But I can’t ignore it.”</p>
<p>She crossed her arms. “And what if you don’t find it? What if you’re
chasing a memory that doesn’t exist?”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll build a new home somewhere else.” I gestured toward the
surrounding forest. “As long as the land is marked for expanding the
town, anyone can claim it. I can always rebuild.”</p>
<p>Neia stared at me as if I had lost my mind. And maybe, to her, I
had.</p>
<p>Finally, she let out a long sigh and pinched the bridge of her nose.
“You really are hopeless.”</p>
<p>I smiled slightly. “That’s what people keep telling me.”</p>
<p>She groaned. “Fine. Whatever. Go off and chase ghosts. But you’re not
doing it alone.”</p>
<p>I blinked. “What?”</p>
<p>She crossed her arms. “I’m coming with you.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to—”</p>
<p>“I know I don’t have to. I want to.” She jabbed a finger at my chest.
“Someone has to make sure you don’t get robbed, starve, or get eaten by
a bear. And besides, I don’t have anything to lose. I don’t even own a
house.”</p>
<p>I hesitated. “…Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Obviously.” She sighed. “At least this way, I’ll have a good story
to tell if we end up lost forever in some forgotten corner of the
kingdom.”</p>
<p>I chuckled. “Then let’s find out where the road takes us.”</p>
<p>And so, with nothing but the clothes on our backs and a handful of
coins in my pocket, Neia and I left Alba’s Hollow behind. The road
stretched before us, uncertain and endless. But for the first time in
years, I felt as though I was walking toward something I had long
forgotten.</p>
<p>Toward a past that was waiting for me to remember.</p>
<p>As Neia and I traveled, the road unfolded before us like a thread
spun by fate, weaving us through forests, villages, and stretches of
open land. Though my purpose was to find my old village, I could not
abandon the way I had always lived.</p>
<p>Each town we passed had its own troubles, and I could not help but
stop when I saw someone in need.</p>
<p>In a small village by the river, we stopped to rest at an inn. That
evening, as we sat outside beneath the lantern glow, a man approached us
hesitantly. He was tall, his arms thick with muscle from years at the
forge, but his eyes were shadowed with worry.</p>
<p>“You’re the wanderer who helps people, aren’t you?” he asked.</p>
<p>Neia smirked and elbowed me lightly. “Told you your reputation was
spreading.”</p>
<p>I simply nodded.</p>
<p>The blacksmith sighed. “It’s my son. Ever since his mother died, he
refuses to touch a hammer. He was meant to inherit my trade, but now…”
He shook his head. “I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried everything, but
he won’t even step into the forge.”</p>
<p>I thought for a moment. “Where is he now?”</p>
<p>The blacksmith pointed toward the river, where a young boy sat alone
on the banks, tossing stones into the water.</p>
<p>I walked over and sat beside him without a word. For a long time, we
simply watched the river together. He skipped a stone. I skipped one
too.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to tell me to pick up a hammer, are you?” he
finally asked.</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>He glanced at me. “Then why are you here?”</p>
<p>I thought about it. “Because sometimes, when the world grows too
loud, it helps to have someone sit beside you in silence.”</p>
<p>The boy said nothing. But after a long pause, he whispered, “I see my
mother’s face every time I enter the forge. It feels like I can’t
breathe.”</p>
<p>I nodded, watching the ripples spread across the water. “Then don’t
enter it. Not yet. Instead, try something new.”</p>
<p>“…Like what?”</p>
<p>I picked up a small piece of driftwood, smooth from years in the
river, and handed it to him. “Start with this. If your hands won’t hold
a hammer, let them carve.”</p>
<p>He hesitated, then took it.</p>
<p>A week later, as Neia and I prepared to leave, the blacksmith found
me again. He didn’t say anything at first—just held up a small wooden
carving of a bird.</p>
<p>“My son made this,” he said. “Said he wanted to give it to me.”</p>
<p>The weight in his voice was heavy with unshed tears.</p>
<p>As I took the wooden bird in my hands, I smiled.</p>
<p>Deep in the woods, as we walked the winding paths toward the next
village, we were ambushed. Five men, ragged and thin, leapt from the
trees, weapons drawn.</p>
<p>“Give us your money,” their leader growled.</p>
<p>Neia, hand on her dagger, tensed beside me. But I raised a hand to
stop her and simply looked at them.</p>
<p>Their clothes were tattered. Their hands shook. And more than
anything else, their eyes were hollow—not with cruelty, but with
desperation.</p>
<p>I reached into my satchel, pulled out a bundle of dried bread and
fruit, and tossed it to the leader. He caught it, startled.</p>
<p>“What—?”</p>
<p>“You’re not thieves,” I said. “You’re starving.”</p>
<p>The men hesitated. One of them, younger than the rest, bit his lip as
his eyes darted toward the food.</p>
<p>Slowly, their leader lowered his sword. “…We were farmers once,” he
muttered. “A nobleman took our land. We had nothing left.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Then take this.” I handed him a small pouch of coins—the
last of what remained from selling my cabin.</p>
<p>Neia gawked. “Are you serious?”</p>
<p>But the man took it, his hands trembling.</p>
<p>“There’s a village not far from here,” I told him. “They need
workers. Go there, tell them you can mend fences, till fields, or do
whatever needs doing.”</p>
<p>One of the bandits fell to his knees, his voice cracking. “You’re
giving us a second chance?”</p>
<p>I smiled. “Everyone deserves one.”</p>
<p>By the time we reached the next village, there were no more bandits
in those woods.</p>
<p>In a quiet town where the air smelled of wheat and earth, we met an
old man lying beneath an oak tree. His breaths were shallow, his skin
pale. A woman knelt beside him, holding his hand.</p>
<p>“He’s been asking for someone to take his final words to his son,”
she told us. “But the journey is long, and no one has the time.”</p>
<p>I knelt beside the man. His eyes fluttered open.</p>
<p>“Stranger,” he rasped. “Will you carry my words?”</p>
<p>I took his frail hand. “Tell me.”</p>
<p>With the last of his strength, he spoke of regret. Of love unspoken.
Of a son he had not seen in years, living in a distant town. I etched
his words into memory.</p>
<p>That night, he passed away beneath the oak.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Neia and I arrived at a bustling city far from where
we had started. We found the man’s son in a small bakery, kneading
dough.</p>
<p>When I told him of his father’s words, he stood in silence for a long
time. Then, without a word, he removed his apron, closed his shop, and
began preparing for a journey back home.</p>
<p>Neia watched him go, then turned to me. “You didn’t just deliver his
words. You brought him home.”</p>
<p>I only nodded.</p>
<p>And so, our journey continued.</p>
<p>Wherever we went, there were people in need—some seeking answers,
some seeking hope, and some simply seeking someone to listen.</p>
<p>I did what I had always done.</p>
<p>I walked. I listened. I helped.</p>
<p>And through it all, the thought of the blue-haired figure never left
my mind.</p>
<p>We came across a small village nestled at the foot of a hill. It was
the kind of place where time seemed to move slower, where children ran
barefoot through the fields, and elders sat outside their homes,
watching the world pass by.</p>
<p>Neia and I had stopped to rest near a well when I noticed an elderly
woman struggling to carry a bundle of thatch up a ladder. Her house, old
and weather-worn, had gaping holes in its roof, and the sky above
carried the promise of rain.</p>
<p>Before I could think twice, I was already beside her, taking the
bundle from her hands.</p>
<p>“You’ll hurt yourself,” I said gently.</p>
<p>She peered up at me with tired eyes. “The roof leaks when it
rains.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Then let’s fix it.”</p>
<p>Neia sighed behind me. “Of course.”</p>
<p>I climbed onto the roof and began patching the holes, weaving the
thatch tightly so it would hold against the wind. It took the rest of
the afternoon, and by the time I was done, the sky had darkened. The old
woman, who had watched silently, pressed a small cloth bundle into my
hands.</p>
<p>“Food for the road,” she said. “It’s all I can give.”</p>
<p>I did not refuse her kindness.</p>
<p>That night, as Neia and I rested under a tree at the village’s edge,
she chuckled.</p>
<p>“You’re really incapable of walking past a problem, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I smiled at the stars above. “Maybe.”</p>
<p>Further along the road, we entered a bustling market town. Stalls
lined the streets, voices rose in lively arguments, and the air smelled
of spiced bread and fresh fruits.</p>
<p>As we passed, I overheard a heated conversation—a merchant and a
farmer locked in an argument. The farmer, red-faced with frustration,
pointed at the merchant’s brass scales.</p>
<p>“These scales are false!” the farmer accused. “You’re cheating
me!”</p>
<p>The merchant scoffed. “Lies! My scales are honest.”</p>
<p>I stepped forward. “May I test them?”</p>
<p>Both men turned to me. The merchant hesitated but waved a hand. “Go
ahead.”</p>
<p>I took a small rock from the ground and placed it on the scale. Then,
I removed it and placed an identical-looking stone from another part of
the street. The scale tilted ever so slightly different.</p>
<p>Neia, catching on, grabbed a handful of weights from another stall
and started testing them. It took only a few moments to confirm it—the
merchant’s scales were subtly, but undeniably, rigged.</p>
<p>The crowd around us murmured. The merchant paled.</p>
<p>“I—” he began, but the whispers turned to shouts.</p>
<p>In the end, he was forced to return the extra coin he had unfairly
taken.</p>
<p>As we left the market, Neia smirked. “You really do cause trouble
everywhere you go.”</p>
<p>I chuckled. “The world sorts itself out. I just give it a little
push.”</p>
<p>One evening, as we passed through another village, I noticed a young
girl sitting outside a house, staring at a wooden cage. Inside it, a
small bird flapped its wings restlessly.</p>
<p>She sighed. “I thought it would be happy with me,” she murmured.</p>
<p>I knelt beside her. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>She hesitated. “I found this bird with a broken wing. I took care of
it, fed it, and nursed it back to health. But now, it doesn’t sing. It
just sits there.”</p>
<p>I looked at the bird. Then at the sky.</p>
<p>“Maybe it sings where it belongs.”</p>
<p>The girl frowned. “But if I let it go, it might get hurt again.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.” I nodded. “But maybe it will fly.”</p>
<p>She stared at me for a long time. Then, with trembling hands, she
opened the cage.</p>
<p>The bird hesitated.</p>
<p>Then, with a burst of energy, it shot into the sky, wings beating
fast. It disappeared into the fading light.</p>
<p>The girl smiled.</p>
<p>Neia leaned against the fence, watching. “That bird reminds me of
someone.”</p>
<p>I turned to her. “Who?”</p>
<p>She grinned. “You.”</p>
<p>The road had stretched long behind us, yet Neia had changed more than
the path beneath our feet.</p>
<p>It was in the way she mirrored my habits without meaning to—how she
no longer counted her coins before every meal, how she stopped eyeing
merchants for the best deal and instead shared food with strangers
without a second thought. It was in the way she teased me now, light and
effortless, as if daring me to react.</p>
<p>“You never get tired, do you?” she sighed one evening as I helped an
old farmer repair a broken fence. She leaned against the post, watching
me with her arms crossed, pretending to be indifferent. “Are you sure
you weren’t actually born with a halo?”</p>
<p>I smiled, tying the last knot. “If I was, I must have misplaced
it.”</p>
<p>She snorted but said nothing else. Still, she lingered until the work
was done, and when the farmer offered us food in thanks, she accepted
without hesitation.</p>
<p>It was near sundown when we reached the heavily guarded town of
Haldor’s Gate. The walls loomed high, and the men stationed at the
entrance looked far from welcoming. Neither of us had permits, and
neither of us wished to waste time being turned away.</p>
<p>“We can go around,” I said simply.</p>
<p>Neia nodded absentmindedly.</p>
<p>But then, her eyes caught something beyond the gate.</p>
<p>A guard—a man with one arm—stood at the edge of the barracks, his
face set in a passive, dull expression. Around him, two younger guards
laughed and jeered, shoving him lightly, testing his balance as if
waiting for him to fall.</p>
<p>Neia’s fingers curled slightly.</p>
<p>Her gaze stayed on the man longer than it should have. She turned
away, acting as though she had seen nothing, but I had already noticed
the way her shoulders had stiffened, the way her breath had hitched for
just a second.</p>
<p>I did not ask.</p>
<p>That night, when she finally slept, I left.</p>
<p>Sneaking past the guards was effortless. I found the one-armed man
sitting in the shadows near the back of the barracks, his hand loosely
gripping a bottle.</p>
<p>“You weren’t with them,” I said.</p>
<p>He blinked at me, then let out a hollow chuckle. “What’s it to
you?”</p>
<p>I sat beside him.</p>
<p>For a while, neither of us spoke. The wind carried the sounds of
distant music from the town square, muffled beneath the weight of the
walls. Eventually, he sighed and set his drink down.</p>
<p>“My name’s Ikor,” he said. “Or at least, that’s what it was before I
became a ghost.”</p>
<p>He told me his story.</p>
<p>A soldier. A survivor. A man who should have died on the battlefield
but instead threw away his name to escape it all. He spoke of war and
betrayal, of officials who saw men as nothing more than numbers on a
parchment. He spoke of two younger sisters—Elthea, who had been sold
like cattle, and Neia, who had run.</p>
<p>“When I see them…” He swallowed. “When I see any woman in chains, any
girl with dead eyes—I look, and I look, and I look. But I never find
them.”</p>
<p>I sat still, the pieces falling into place.</p>
<p>There was only one way to be sure.</p>
<p>Neia woke to find us both sitting near her. The fire had long since
burned to embers.</p>
<p>She did not ask how.</p>
<p>She did not ask why.</p>
<p>She simply closed her eyes for a long moment and exhaled.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to face my past,” she admitted, voice barely above a
whisper. “I thought I had left it behind.”</p>
<p>Ikor watched her carefully. “You really thought I wouldn’t recognize
you?”</p>
<p>“I was hoping you wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>Silence stretched between them.</p>
<p>Then, quietly, Ikor chuckled. “You still glare when you’re hiding
something.”</p>
<p>She blinked, startled, before scoffing. “You’re still the same idiot
who threw punches before thinking.”</p>
<p>The tension broke.</p>
<p>They spoke—of the years that had passed, of what had been lost and
what had been found. But every time the conversation lulled, Neia turned
it toward me.</p>
<p>“He never asks for anything,” she murmured. “Never takes anything.
I’ve never seen anyone like him before.”</p>
<p>And then she sang.</p>
<pre><code>
I watch you sweep the stones each day,
With mindful grace, the dust drifts far and free.
At first, I thought, what foolish way—
Is there no greater path to see?
Yet now I hear the words unspoken,
In every leaf the wind has turned,
No lesson etched in ink or token—
Yet in your hands, the truth is learned.

You do not chase, you do not cling,
You walk as though the earth is kind.
No chain to break, no crown to bring,
No fear of what is left behind.
And when I asked, &quot;What guides your days?&quot;
You only smiled, as soft as rain—
&quot;The stream that bends will find its way,
The stone that stays will only wane.&quot;

No walls to guard, no path to bind,
No need to grasp, no will to fight.
The river flows, the stars will shine,
And all will come in its own time.

I walked a world of fire and stone,
Where hunger taught my hands to steal.
Where loss became the seeds I’d sown,
And love seemed far, too far to feel.
But in your quiet, I found space,
Between each breath, a softer tune.
The sky was never empty air—
It held the sun, it cradled the moon.

No walls to guard, no path to bind,
No need to grasp, no will to fight.
The river flows, the stars will shine,
And all will come in its own time.

So now I sweep the stones each day,
The dust will rise, the dust will fade.
The world moves on, and so will I—
Not lost, not bound, just free to fly.</code></pre>
<p>Her voice was low at first, almost uncertain, but then it grew—soft
yet unshaken, carrying the words she had woven from her own heart.</p>
<p>Ikor listened with a smirk.</p>
<p>“You’re in love with him,” he said when she finished.</p>
<p>Neia sputtered. “I—”</p>
<p>He laughed. “You talk about him more than yourself. And you never
sing for anyone.”</p>
<p>Her face burned, but she crossed her arms stubbornly. “I’m not—”</p>
<p>He raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“…Shut up.”</p>
<p>Ikor only grinned.</p>
<p>When the night began to fade, Neia stood.</p>
<p>“I’ll visit,” she promised. “But I’m not staying.”</p>
<p>Ikor eyed her before glancing at me. Then he smirked. “I didn’t think
you would.”</p>
<p>She caught up to me just as I was preparing to leave.</p>
<p>“You’re still here?” I asked.</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “You’re not getting rid of me that easily.”</p>
<p>And so, we walked on.</p>
<p>The moment I stepped into the village, something in me stirred. It
wasn’t a memory, not yet—just a feeling, a quiet whisper that I had
stood here before, that the wind had carried my breath in this very
place. The scent of the air, the way the earth felt beneath my feet, the
rhythm of life here—it was familiar.</p>
<p>I asked around, searching for someone, anyone, who might remember me.
But each time, I was met with blank stares. Some of the older folk
recalled my parents, but only faintly, as passing figures from long
ago.</p>
<p>And when I asked about a blue-haired girl, the answer was always the
same.</p>
<p>“No one like that ever lived here.”</p>
<p>Even so, I knew. I couldn’t explain it, but I knew.</p>
<p>Neia must have noticed the way my shoulders sagged, the way my eyes
kept searching for something I couldn’t name. She placed a hand on my
arm.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you rest? I’ll ask around more.”</p>
<p>I hesitated, then shook my head. “I think I’ll take a walk in the
forest.”</p>
<p>She gave me a long look, then sighed. “Alright. Just don’t get
lost.”</p>
<p>The trees stretched high above, their branches whispering in the
wind. I walked without direction, guided only by an invisible thread of
familiarity. The deeper I went, the stronger it became, until finally, I
stepped into a clearing.</p>
<p>And there it was.</p>
<p>An ancient tree stood at its edge, roots sprawling like veins across
the earth, its trunk thick and scarred by time. I didn’t know why, but
the moment I saw it, my heart clenched.</p>
<p>I took a step forward.</p>
<p>Then another.</p>
<p>And suddenly, I wasn’t standing there as I was now.</p>
<p>I was smaller, my hands still soft with childhood. I was running
across this clearing, laughing, breathless. And beside me—</p>
<p>A presence.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see her face, but I could feel her there, watching over me
with quiet patience. A friend. Someone I had once known.</p>
<p>Someone I had forgotten.</p>
<p>A warmth spread through my chest, achingly familiar. More memories
slipped through the cracks, slow at first, then all at once—the touch of
a gentle hand on my forehead, the soft hum of words I could barely
understand, the flickering mirages of light and air that had once felt
like magic.</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>A song.</p>
<p>A melody rose unbidden in my mind, ghostly and familiar, as if it had
been waiting all these years. A voice—soft yet vast, unshaken, like the
sky itself.</p>
<p>And with it, a name.</p>
<p>A name I had buried in the depths of my forgotten past.</p>
<p>“…Ciel.”</p>
<p>The word escaped my lips before I could think, and the moment it did,
everything fell into place.</p>
<pre><code>Softly falls the evening’s glow, the day becomes a sigh,
With footsteps worn on paths I know, beneath a patient sky.
The wind brings echoes, faint and warm, from places far and near,
A fleeting shape, a distant name—so close, and yet unclear.

The hearthlight flickers—stories weave, of longing and release,
Of loves that slipped like morning dew, yet left the heart at peace.
A single petal, drifting down, unfolds a hidden thread—
A voice I knew, a vow unsaid, from dreams I thought had fled.

Ciel—the dawn, the gentle rain, the breath between the trees—
She taught me how the world could sing through whispers on the breeze.
In childhood’s spring, she touched my soul, then faded with the tide—
But every path I’ve walked since then has kept her by my side.

No need to chase, no need to bind—what’s lost returns in time.
The river knows, the mountains keep, what fate makes hers and mine.
I’ve sought no crown, nor fought the sky—just followed nature’s flow—
And through the stillness of my heart, I found what I let go.

The wind may scatter leaves afar—
Yet every leaf becomes a star—
No distance, time, or world above
Can break the bond of silent love.

So let her be where she must go—
The stream will meet the sea—
And if the sky returns her name,
She’ll find her way to me.

No grasping hands, no cries, no fight—
Just faith that darkness leads to light—
For what is meant will always stay—
A blossom borne upon the way.</code></pre>
<p>Ciel. The angel of wisdom.</p>
<p>She had been here. She had always been here.</p>
<p>And I—</p>
<p>I had forgotten her.</p>
<p>I searched the forest for hours, following the faintest hints of
memory. Every rustling leaf, every shifting shadow felt like it might
reveal her, but no matter how far I walked, I never found what I was
looking for.</p>
<p>The wind stirred around me, gentle yet insistent, like a whisper from
the past. A thought came to me, unbidden.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the wind.</strong></p>
<p>It had led me home once before. Would it do so again?</p>
<p>Closing my eyes, I let the breeze guide me, my feet moving without
thought. It twisted through the trees, curling around trunks and
slipping between branches, and I followed like I had so many years ago,
my heart pounding with quiet hope.</p>
<p>But when I opened my eyes, I stood before something I did not
expect.</p>
<p>My old home.</p>
<p>Or at least, what was left of it.</p>
<p>The house was in tatters, the roof partially collapsed, vines
creeping over the wooden walls. The windows were broken, the door barely
holding onto its hinges. It had the look of something long abandoned,
yet not completely forgotten.</p>
<p>I asked around, hoping for some connection to the past, some trace of
familiarity. Most people shrugged, indifferent, but eventually, I found
someone who knew.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be an inn soon,” they told me. “The new owner plans to
fix it up.”</p>
<p>I stood there for a while, looking at the broken remains of what had
once been my world. The place where I had lived, where my parents had
laughed, where I had first run into the woods and met—</p>
<p>I turned away.</p>
<p>Neia was waiting for me when I returned, arms crossed, eyes scanning
my face. “Did you find anything?”</p>
<p>I nodded, sitting down on a nearby stone. “I remember now. Her name
was Ciel.”</p>
<p>Something flickered in Neia’s expression—something small, something
painful.</p>
<p>“Ciel,” she repeated softly.</p>
<p>“The angel of wisdom,” I murmured.</p>
<p>She looked away. “And now?”</p>
<p>I exhaled, the answer coming as naturally as breathing. “Now, I find
her.”</p>
<p>For a moment, she was silent. Then she let out a sharp, bitter laugh.
“Just like that?”</p>
<p>I tilted my head, unsure of what she meant.</p>
<p>She shook her head, her voice suddenly raw. “You’re just going to
leave? Just like that?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to come,” I said gently. “You can go back now.”</p>
<p>Neia’s hands clenched into fists at her sides. “Go back? Rimuru, you
brought me this far! The least you could do is—”</p>
<p>She stopped herself, biting her lip. Then, after a long, shaky
breath, she looked up at me with eyes burning with unshed tears.
“No. No, you know what? I don’t want to go back. I want to keep
going.”</p>
<p>I hesitated. “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>She let out a short, shaky laugh, wiping at her eyes with the back of
her hand. “You always ask me that, but you already know the answer.”</p>
<p>I gave a small nod. “Then we’ll have to work along the way. I don’t
have money.”</p>
<p>Neia let out a breath, steadier now. “Fine by me.”</p>
<p>That night, as the fire crackled between us, Neia sat alone, gazing
into the flames. I could hear her humming—soft and low, almost like a
whisper to herself.</p>
<p>A song.</p>
<p>A melody I hadn’t heard before, yet something about it felt…
familiar.</p>
<pre><code>I see the way you look at her,
The softness in your eyes.
A love so deep, so far beyond
The reach of space and time.

And though I stand here by your side,
I know your heart’s not mine.
Yet still, I stay, though words unspoken
Hang between the lines.

I will wait, through sun and rain,
Through fleeting days and years of change.
I won’t ask, I won’t chase,
I’ll stand right here if you turn my way.

I’ve walked alone through fire and stone,
Through loss too great to tell.
But even pain was easier
Than loving you this well.

For love that’s free will find its way,
And love that’s true won’t fade.
So even if you never choose me,
Still, my heart will stay.

I will wait, through sun and rain,
Through fleeting days and years of change.
I won’t ask, I won’t chase,
I’ll stand right here if you turn my way.

And if the road should bring you back,
If someday you should see—
That love was waiting all along,
Then come and stay with me.

But if your heart stays far away,
Then I will let you go.
For love should never beg to stay,
It only hopes you know.

I will wait, I will stay,
Even if you never turn my way.</code></pre>
<p>She didn’t look at me as she sang, her voice just above the crackling
embers, carrying words I could barely catch. But there was something in
her tone, something in the way her fingers curled slightly against her
knees, in the way her eyes shimmered in the firelight.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask.</p>
<p>Instead, I closed my eyes and listened.</p>
<p>As we traveled, Neia began to change. Or perhaps, she had always been
this way, and I had only now begun to see it.</p>
<p>At first, she only watched as I helped people—lifting a broken cart
from the mud, mending a torn roof, listening as an old woman wept over
the past. But slowly, she began stepping forward on her own.</p>
<p>One day, we passed through a village stricken by drought. The people
were weary, their fields cracked, their wells nearly dry. I sat beneath
a tree, listening as they spoke of their troubles, but I had no answer
for them.</p>
<p>Neia, however, did not wait for an answer.</p>
<p>She disappeared for a while, and when she returned, it was with a
group of children, leading them toward the river at the village’s edge.
She knelt beside them, cupping her hands into the flowing water.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to dig a canal?” she asked.</p>
<p>The children shook their heads.</p>
<p>She smiled. “Then let’s learn.”</p>
<p>She rolled up her sleeves and began digging, shaping a path for the
water. The children followed her lead, their small hands scooping dirt,
their voices lifting with laughter. Soon, the village men and women
joined in, drawn by the sight of their children working together.</p>
<p>By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, a narrow channel had
been carved, guiding the river’s flow toward their fields.</p>
<p>One of the elders looked at me and said, “You have our deepest
thanks.”</p>
<p>I tilted my head. “But I did nothing.”</p>
<p>He only smiled. “Yet, somehow, you always bring what is needed.”</p>
<p>Another time, in a bustling town, we came across a woman weeping in
the marketplace. She clutched a tattered shawl to her chest, murmuring
prayers under her breath.</p>
<p>Neia knelt beside her. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>The woman looked up with tear-streaked cheeks. “My husband… He was
taken away for debts. They’ll send him to the mines. I have nothing
left.”</p>
<p>Neia turned to me. “Can’t you help?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I have no money.”</p>
<p>Neia’s gaze sharpened, thoughtful. “Then we don’t need money.”</p>
<p>She stood and scanned the marketplace, her eyes landing on a group of
street performers—dancers, musicians, acrobats. A smile spread across
her lips.</p>
<p>She grabbed my wrist. “Come on.”</p>
<p>Before I could protest, she pulled me into the open square, where the
performers were gathering a crowd. She approached a fiddler, speaking to
him in quick, excited whispers. Then, with a sudden twirl, she leapt
onto an overturned crate.</p>
<p>And she began to sing.</p>
<p>Her voice carried through the air, weaving through the marketplace
like a golden thread. The crowd hushed, drawn to her melody. It was a
song of longing, of love lost and found, of the struggles of the
heart.</p>
<pre><code>In this vast universe
Among the many stars
In a single vast blue planet
My small feelings of love would reach
to that tiny island where you are

Time had passed since I met you
And the letters adorning our feelings are also increasing
Someday, they will echo unnoticed in our hearts
At times violently, at times sorrowfully

They will echo faraway, into the far-off distance
This tender song will change the world

Look now
The person who you cherish
Is right beside you
I wish
for this to reach just you
Resonate, my song of love
Look now...
Resound, my song of love

You come to realise,
that even when the two of us should walk a dark road
The moon would illuminate our days
Never letting go of your hand I&#39;ve clasped
Our feelings are strong
and we vow it&#39;s for all eternity
In the depths of eternity
I will surely say the exact same words
with my feelings still the same
But those words will never cease
they will turn into tears
Then to joy
Unable to speak
I&#39;ll just embrace you

Look now
The person who you cherish
Is right beside you
I wish
for this to reach just you
Resonate, my song of love
Look now...
Resound, my song of love

If it&#39;s a dream don&#39;t wake me up
If it&#39;s a dream don&#39;t wake me up
The time I&#39;ve spent with you
Shall become a star
shining eternally

Look now
The person who you cherish
is right besides you
I wish
for this to reach just you
Oh resound, my song of love
Look now
the person who you cherish
Is right beside you
I wish
for this to reach just you
Resonate, my song of love
Look now...
Look now!
Resound, my song of love</code></pre>
<p>I watched as coins began to fill a small basket at her feet. The
fiddler played alongside her, the acrobats turned their tricks to the
rhythm of her voice, and soon, the entire square pulsed with life.</p>
<p>By the time she finished, the woman who had wept was no longer
crying. In her hands was enough coin to buy her husband’s freedom.</p>
<p>Once again, the people thanked me.</p>
<p>And once again, I wondered why.</p>
<p>There were many moments like these. Neia, without realizing it, had
begun to take part in the way of things. She never thought about it the
way I did—never questioned whether what she did was fate or mere
coincidence.</p>
<p>She simply saw what was needed, and she acted.</p>
<p>And so, the road stretched on, beneath a sky that carried us forward,
and ended up getting lost in a forest track.</p>
<p>The forest was silent save for the soft rustling of leaves, the
gentle murmur of the wind weaving through the branches. The air was
thick with the scent of damp earth and wildflowers, and somewhere in the
distance, a brook babbled over smooth stones.</p>
<p>And then, I saw her.</p>
<p>Ciel knelt in a clearing, her deep blue hair flowing like liquid
night, her crimson eyes calm as she ran a delicate hand over the injured
calf at her side. The animal trembled, its leg twisted unnaturally, but
under her touch, it stilled, its breathing slowing, as if it knew—just
as I knew—who she was.</p>
<p>My heart caught in my throat.</p>
<p>For a long time, I had chased a memory, a fleeting glimpse of color
through the trees, the ghost of a name on my lips. And now, standing
here, I was once again a child running barefoot through the woods,
laughing in the wind, reaching for a hand that was never meant to
stay.</p>
<p>She looked up at me, and her lips curled into a familiar, gentle
smile.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time, Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Hearing my name in her voice after all these years—spoken with such
warmth, such certainty—sent a shiver through me. I swallowed, trying to
find words, but none came.</p>
<p>Instead, I dropped to my knees beside her, reaching out hesitantly.
My fingers hovered over her sleeve, afraid that if I touched her, she
might vanish like mist in the morning sun.</p>
<p>“You’re real,” I breathed.</p>
<p>She laughed softly, a sound like the whisper of the wind through the
trees. “I have always been real.”</p>
<p>Neia stood a little behind me, quiet, watching. I could feel her
presence, her gaze heavy, but she said nothing.</p>
<p>Ciel turned back to the calf, her hands glowing faintly as she traced
over its wounded limb. “You’ve grown,” she said, as if we were simply
catching up, as if years hadn’t passed like autumn leaves swept
downstream.</p>
<p>I let out a breathless laugh. “And you haven’t changed at all.”</p>
<p>Her smile deepened, but there was something in her eyes—something
softer, something sadder.</p>
<p>We talked. About the past, about the days we spent together in the
woods. I told her of the village, of my journey, of how I had spent so
long trying to remember her. She listened with the same patience she had
always had, nodding, her fingers running absentmindedly through the
calf’s fur.</p>
<p>And then, as the wind shifted, she spoke words I was not ready to
hear.</p>
<p>“I already know, Rimuru.” Her voice was quiet, but unwavering. “I
know that you love me.”</p>
<p>The world seemed to still around me.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, but no words came. Because she was right.</p>
<p>It was not a love of possession, nor a love that begged for
reciprocation. It was something deeper, something woven into the very
fabric of my soul. A love that simply was.</p>
<p>She lowered her gaze. “But I am not meant for this world. I cannot
stay with you.”</p>
<p>The air grew heavier, pressing against my chest. I clenched my hands
into fists, fingers digging into the earth.</p>
<p>“Why?” The word barely left my lips, a whisper lost to the wind.</p>
<p>She lifted her hand, brushing her fingers against my cheek. “Because
I am an angel, and you are mortal. Our paths were never meant to walk
side by side.”</p>
<p>I bowed my head, eyes burning. My breath came unsteady, my body
trembling under the weight of something I had never allowed myself to
acknowledge.</p>
<p>For the first time since I was a child, I cried.</p>
<p>Ciel watched me, and though she had always been the picture of
serenity, her own eyes glistened. This was not the farewell of a cold,
untouchable being. This was something real. Something painful.</p>
<p>Then she turned to Neia.</p>
<p>“Neia,” she said, and I felt Neia stiffen behind me.</p>
<p>“Please,” Ciel continued, “be with him.”</p>
<p>Neia inhaled sharply.</p>
<p>Ciel smiled, her usual composure cracking just slightly, revealing
the sorrow beneath. “I can’t stay, but you can. And I will visit. I
promise.”</p>
<p>Neia bit her lip, her hands curling into fists. She didn’t
answer.</p>
<p>Ciel looked back at me, one final time.</p>
<p>“This is goodbye,” she said, her voice breaking at the edges.</p>
<p>She took a step back, then another. And then, like the wind itself,
she was gone.</p>
<p>I sat there, my hands still curled into the earth, staring at the
space where she had stood. The air still smelled of her—like rain and
wildflowers.</p>
<p>Neia kneeled beside me, silent for a long while. Then, in a voice
barely above a whisper, she began to sing.</p>
<p>Her song carried through the clearing, soft and trembling, wrapping
around me like a gentle embrace. The words drifted over me like falling
petals, and though my heart ached, I let them in.</p>
<pre><code>The wind still carries echoes soft,
Of voices lost to time.
The stars still shine, though clouds may drift,
Their light will always find.

She was never meant to stay,
Like rivers never rest.
But love that’s true won’t fade away,
It lingers in your chest.

She walks with the wind, she sings with the trees,
She’s part of the world, as far as it seems.
Though hands cannot hold her, nor time make her stay,
She’ll always be near, in her own quiet way.

Tears may fall like autumn leaves,
Let them go, don’t hold them tight.
For love is not in chains we weave,
But in the warmth that fills the night.

If you close your eyes, she’ll be right here,
In whispered winds and silver streams.
No distance breaks the love you share,
She lives within your dreams.

And as you grieve, as you let go,
Know I will never ask too much.
You need not love me as you love her,
Just leave a space for me, just enough.

She walks with the wind, she sings with the trees,
She’s part of the world, as far as it seems.
Though hands cannot hold her, nor time make her stay,
She’ll always be near, in her own quiet way.

So take your time, don’t turn away,
I ask for nothing more.
Just let me stay beside your heart,
A place that’s mine—no less, no more.
</code></pre>
<p>She was never meant to stay,<br />
Like rivers never rest.<br />
But love that’s true won’t fade away,<br />
It lingers in your chest.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>The wind still carried echoes of a voice I would never forget. And
yet, through the grief, through the aching emptiness left behind, I
could still feel her.</p>
<p>Always near.</p>
<p>In her own quiet way.</p>
<p>The days passed, and the road stretched endlessly ahead. Though my
feet moved forward, my heart remained tethered to the place we had left
behind. The forest still whispered in my mind—Ciel’s presence lingering
like an imprint on my soul.</p>
<p>Neia walked beside me, her usual energy subdued, though she never
said anything outright. She didn’t need to. The silence between us was a
knowing one, filled with things neither of us dared to say aloud.</p>
<p>That afternoon, we came across a broken cart abandoned by the
roadside. The wheels lay askew, one of them snapped clean through.
Scattered grain littered the ground, a few birds pecking at the stray
kernels.</p>
<p>Neia sighed, setting down her pack. “Looks like someone’s bad
day.”</p>
<p>I crouched beside the wheel, running my fingers along the splintered
wood. “Maybe it doesn’t have to be.”</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow. “You plan on fixing it?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “It would be a shame to leave it like this.”</p>
<p>So we worked. I gathered fallen branches from the nearby trees,
whittling and shaping them until they fit snugly into place. Neia
secured the bindings, her hands skilled and sure. The sun dipped lower
as we labored, sweat beading on our brows, but by dusk, the cart stood
whole again.</p>
<p>We found its owner in the next village—a weary farmer whose gratitude
was worth more than coin. He offered us sacks of wheat as thanks, and
with little else to do, we struck a deal.</p>
<p>And so, for the next few months, we became merchants of sorts.</p>
<p>It was simple work, ferrying wheat and flour between the village and
the town’s mill. The roads grew familiar, the weight of the sacks became
second nature. The town—Merrivale—was lively, its people accustomed to
traders and travelers alike.</p>
<p>Neia took well to the work. She haggled with an ease I lacked, her
sharp tongue and quick wit often earning us a better deal than I ever
could. I merely watched, amused, as she playfully sparred with
merchants, always walking away with a victorious smirk.</p>
<p>Between our round trips, our conversations grew longer.</p>
<p>One evening, as we sat by the river washing the dust from our hands,
she asked, “Why do you live the way you do?”</p>
<p>I glanced at her. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>She gestured vaguely. “You don’t chase after money, power, or even
stability. You just… let things happen.”</p>
<p>I considered her words, watching as the water curled around my
fingers. “I suppose I don’t see the point in chasing things that fade.
Wealth comes and goes. Power is fleeting. Even stability is an
illusion—one bad storm, one twist of fate, and it all crumbles. But
harmony… harmony lasts.”</p>
<p>She frowned. “And how do you define harmony?”</p>
<p>“A balance between what is and what should be.”</p>
<p>She scoffed. “That sounds vague.”</p>
<p>I smiled. “It is.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes but didn’t press further.</p>
<p>Yet as the days turned to weeks, she kept returning to the topic.
During our journeys, while unloading sacks at the mill, while waiting
for customers, while sharing meals beneath the open sky—she questioned
me, challenged me, probed deeper into my thoughts.</p>
<p>“Do you ever get angry?”</p>
<p>“Not often.”</p>
<p>“But doesn’t that mean you’re just suppressing it?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. Or perhaps I have learned that most things are not worth
anger.”</p>
<p>“What about love, then? Do you just… let that go too?”</p>
<p>I hesitated. Her gaze was piercing, waiting, searching.</p>
<p>“I love in my own way,” I finally said.</p>
<p>She looked away, dissatisfied with the answer but unwilling to
push.</p>
<p>And so it continued. A dance of words, of curiosity, of two minds
trying to understand each other across a chasm neither of us could yet
define.</p>
<p>And in those moments, I realized—Neia was changing. She no longer
questioned me as an outsider peering into something foreign. She
questioned me as someone standing at the edge, uncertain if she should
step forward or turn away.</p>
<p>I saw a boy at the mill, weaving through the bustling crowd with a
confidence that didn’t quite match his years. He was small—no older than
thirteen or fourteen—but his voice carried sharp and clear over the
din.</p>
<p>“Step right up, fine folk! A rare elixir from the eastern lands!
Grants strength, vitality, and—” he paused for dramatic effect, lowering
his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, “—it even keeps nightmares at
bay.”</p>
<p>Neia, arms crossed, leaned toward me. “You believe that?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “Not even slightly.”</p>
<p>Still, I watched. The boy’s hands moved swiftly, gesturing
animatedly, his words flowing like honey. He had the skill of a seasoned
trickster, but his audience was not easily fooled. A burly farmer
snorted and waved him away. A mill worker laughed outright. Someone else
muttered, “Damn brat’s at it again.”</p>
<p>I took a step forward. “That’s quite the claim.”</p>
<p>The boy turned to me, sizing me up in an instant. “Ah, a man of
wisdom, I see! You must know that the best things in life are often
overlooked by common folk.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.” I nodded. “And yet, the best things in life rarely
come in glass bottles.”</p>
<p>The boy’s confidence wavered for the briefest second before his grin
returned, sharper this time. “You wound me, sir! But you see, this is no
ordinary bottle—”</p>
<p>“Come.” I gestured for him to step aside. “Let’s talk.”</p>
<p>His face hardened. Then, without a word, he bolted.</p>
<p>Neia groaned. “Well, that went well.”</p>
<p>I watched his retreating form disappear into the crowd. “I’ll find
him later.”</p>
<p>Weeks passed before I finally tracked him down. Not because he was
particularly good at hiding, but because too many people were eager to
complain about him. Farmers, merchants, innkeepers—all had a story about
how “that wretched boy” had tricked them out of coin, stolen scraps, or
disappeared before paying his dues.</p>
<p>I found him in a half-collapsed barn at the village’s edge, curled up
with a threadbare cloak over his shoulders. When he saw me, his eyes
darted around for an escape route, but I raised a hand.</p>
<p>“I didn’t come to turn you in,” I said.</p>
<p>He scowled, arms tightening around himself.</p>
<p>“The villagers want to beat you,” I continued. “I stopped them.”</p>
<p>His expression barely changed. “And why would you do that?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re still a child.”</p>
<p>He snorted. “You’re a fool.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.” I extended a hand. “Come with me instead.”</p>
<p>He stared at it as if it were a trap. Then, reluctantly, he
stood.</p>
<p>For a month, he stayed with us.</p>
<p>He did not make it easy.</p>
<p>He ate what we gave him but never thanked us. He slept under our roof
but never spoke. Whenever I tried to speak with him, he turned away,
refusing to acknowledge me. He didn’t ask for my name, nor did he care
to share his own.</p>
<p>Neia, however, had a way of getting through to him.</p>
<p>She didn’t press him for answers. She didn’t demand his gratitude.
She simply treated him as if he were always meant to be there—mocking
his grumpiness, dragging him into conversations, making him laugh when
he least expected it.</p>
<p>Slowly, his walls cracked.</p>
<p>And one evening, beside the fire, he spoke.</p>
<p>“I was born into a noble house,” he admitted, eyes fixed on the
flames. “Servants, tutors, expectations—I had all of it. My father
wanted me to be a scholar. My mother wanted me to marry well. Every step
of my life was planned before I even took my first breath.”</p>
<p>Neia said nothing, just listening.</p>
<p>“I hated it,” he continued. “I felt like I wasn’t living, just…
fulfilling someone else’s design. So I ran away, looking for something
real.”</p>
<p>His fingers clenched into fists. “I got lost in the deep woods. A
group of bandits found me, and I thought that was the end of it. But
then… she came.”</p>
<p>His voice softened. “A girl with blue hair. She saved me.”</p>
<p>Neia and I exchanged a glance, but neither of us interrupted.</p>
<p>“I never forgot her,” he murmured. “She felt like something I was
meant to find. So I ran away from home for good. I wanted to see her
again. But the world isn’t kind to a noble boy with no name and no
survival skills.”</p>
<p>He laughed bitterly. “I fell in with the wrong people. Learned all
the wrong things. Lived on lies. And I started to hate her for it.”</p>
<p>His gaze flickered to me. “You remind me of her. That’s why I hate
you too.”</p>
<p>Silence settled between us.</p>
<p>Neia’s voice was gentle when she finally spoke. “So what now?”</p>
<p>He hesitated. For the first time, his expression wasn’t scornful or
guarded. It was uncertain.<br />
He had spent so long running. Perhaps, for the first time, he didn’t
know where to go. He had spent so long running.</p>
<p>As I watched him, something stirred in my chest—an unease, a quiet
understanding.</p>
<p>His story should have been foreign to me, yet I felt as though I had
heard it before.</p>
<p>Or rather, I had lived it.</p>
<p>He was searching for something. Chasing after a fleeting image, a
moment in time that had slipped through his fingers. Was I not the
same?</p>
<p>For years, I had wandered, helping people, moving with the wind,
never staying, never settling. I told myself I had no destination, that
I was merely following the course that life set before me. But was that
true?</p>
<p>Or had I been searching too?</p>
<p>Ciel…</p>
<p>I had spent so long trying to find her, retracing steps I could
barely remember, following whispers in the wind. But what was I hoping
for?</p>
<p>The boy before me, with his restless eyes and clenched fists, was
like a reflection in still water. Both of us chasing something we could
never quite grasp, like a river trying to reach the sky.</p>
<p>Was there an end to such a journey?</p>
<p>Would we ever arrive?</p>
<p>Or would we simply flow on, endlessly?</p>
<p>And so, we set out once again.</p>
<p>This time, our journey had a destination.</p>
<p>The boy—who still refused to tell me his name—traveled with us,
though his steps were slow, as if he were being led to a place he no
longer belonged. He never spoke of his family, never admitted he wanted
to go back. But he did not resist, either.</p>
<p>Neia, as always, walked beside me, stealing glances at the boy when
she thought I wouldn’t notice. She had grown fond of him, though she
never said it outright. Instead, she teased him, argued with him, made
sure he ate enough when he sulked too long. The boy, despite himself,
grew closer to her.</p>
<p>Our path was long, stretching over months. We stopped to help those
we met along the way, sometimes fixing broken carts, sometimes settling
disputes, sometimes simply listening to stories that no one else would
hear. The boy watched it all in silence, though his sharp eyes missed
nothing.</p>
<p>The boy had always been confident in his wit. He believed that clever
words and quick thinking could outmatch anyone. And so, when he saw a
merchant setting up his wares in the town square, he could not resist
the challenge.</p>
<p>The marketplace was bustling, with traders calling out their wares
and customers haggling for better prices. The boy’s sharp eyes locked
onto a merchant arranging bolts of silk on a wooden stall. With a smirk,
he strolled up, feigning disinterest as he ran his fingers over the
fabric.</p>
<p>“This silk?” he scoffed, holding up a roll. “I’ve seen better in the
hands of beggars. You wouldn’t happen to be selling counterfeits, would
you?”</p>
<p>The merchant, an older man with a measured gaze, raised an eyebrow.
“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be generous,” the boy continued, playing the part of an
experienced buyer. “I’ll take it off your hands for half the price.”</p>
<p>The merchant chuckled, eyes twinkling with amusement. “And I suppose
you’ll sell it elsewhere for double?”</p>
<p>The boy hesitated for only a second—just long enough for the merchant
to see through him. Before the boy could respond, the merchant leaned
forward. “You remind me of a younger me. Overconfident. Thinking wit
alone can turn the world in your favor.”</p>
<p>The boy bristled. “I—”</p>
<p>The merchant cut him off. “Listen carefully, boy. A real trader
doesn’t just talk—he listens. The moment you opened your mouth, you
lost.”</p>
<p>The boy’s face darkened as he shoved the silk back onto the table and
stormed away. When we were alone, I spoke. “You’re angry because he was
right.”</p>
<p>He glared at me. “I don’t need advice from a fool who never
haggles.”</p>
<p>I smiled. “And yet, I get what I need without trying.”</p>
<p>He had no response to that.</p>
<p>We found the man on the outskirts of a village, lying beneath a tree.
His breathing was shallow, his wounds long past the point of healing. He
had fought wars he no longer cared to name.</p>
<p>The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden glow over the dry,
cracked ground. Flies buzzed around the man’s wounds, and the faint
scent of blood clung to the air. I sat beside him, the coolness of the
evening settling in.</p>
<p>The boy stood at a distance, shifting uncomfortably. “He’s just…
waiting to die?”</p>
<p>“They left me here,” the soldier murmured, voice cracked with
bitterness. “All the years I spent serving them, and this is how it
ends.”</p>
<p>“You regret it?” I asked.</p>
<p>The soldier coughed out something between a laugh and a curse. “I
regret believing it meant something.”</p>
<p>The boy hesitated before stepping closer. “Shouldn’t we get a
healer?”</p>
<p>“There is no healer for what ails him,” I said.</p>
<p>The soldier exhaled slowly. “You’re not going to tell me I fought for
a noble cause?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. “Good.”</p>
<p>The boy’s fists clenched. “You’re just letting him die?”</p>
<p>I did not respond. We sat with him until his breathing stopped. The
boy did not speak for a long time. When he finally did, his voice was
strained. “You didn’t even try to comfort him.”</p>
<p>“Would it have helped?”</p>
<p>He had no answer. And so we walked on.</p>
<p>In the next village, a crowd had gathered. A farmer knelt in the
dirt, his hands bound, as an angry mob hurled accusations.</p>
<p>The village center was alive with shouts, the smell of sweat and dust
heavy in the air. The accused farmer, a gaunt man with hollow cheeks,
stared at the ground in silent defeat. The crowd around him was
restless, their voices sharp with anger.</p>
<p>“He stole from the grain stores!” one man shouted.</p>
<p>The boy folded his arms. “He probably did.”</p>
<p>I looked at him. “You’re certain?”</p>
<p>He hesitated, then muttered, “People are selfish. That’s just how the
world is.”</p>
<p>I walked past him, toward the bound man. “Did you steal?” I
asked.</p>
<p>The farmer’s eyes were weary, resigned. “No.”</p>
<p>The village leader scoffed. “And I suppose we should just take your
word for it?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said simply. “But truth reveals itself, given time.”</p>
<p>That evening, as the village settled, I walked through the granary.
The entrance was well-guarded, but the back had loose planks, likely
pried open with tools. The markings on the ground showed heavy sacks
dragged toward the tax collector’s house.</p>
<p>When I confronted him the next morning, he laughed. “And what proof
do you have?”</p>
<p>I smiled, producing a torn piece of cloth caught on the granary’s
broken wood—a cloth that matched his robes exactly.</p>
<p>The crowd gasped as realization dawned on them. The tax collector’s
smugness faded, replaced by cold sweat. The farmer’s name was cleared,
and the boy stared in silence.</p>
<p>“People aren’t always selfish,” I told him.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure he could have argued his way through- but because I
was who I am - because people knew me, they chose to believe me.</p>
<p>The boy scowled, but his expression was troubled. A small crack in
his certainty.</p>
<p>One evening, we stopped at a poor household. They had barely enough
food for themselves, yet they shared their bread with us without
hesitation.</p>
<p>The inside of the house was small, dimly lit by a flickering oil
lamp. The wooden table was old and scratched, the chairs mismatched.
Yet, the family’s laughter was light and easy, filling the room with
warmth.</p>
<p>As we sat outside, I noticed a small child laughing, running barefoot
in the dirt, as if the world held no troubles.</p>
<p>The boy watched, frowning. “He has nothing. What’s there to be happy
about?”</p>
<p>I took a slow breath. “He isn’t missing anything.”</p>
<p>The boy scoffed. “Everyone wants more.”</p>
<p>I gestured toward the child. “Then why doesn’t he?”</p>
<p>The boy had no answer.</p>
<p>One night, I woke to the sound of footsteps. The boy was walking
away, his pack slung over his shoulder.</p>
<p>I followed him silently until he stopped at the crossroads outside
the village. He stood there, staring at the paths before him, his hands
tightening around the straps of his bag.</p>
<p>“You’re free to go,” I said.</p>
<p>He flinched but didn’t turn around. “I know.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you stop?”</p>
<p>The wind rustled the leaves. He let out a harsh breath. “Because I
don’t know where to go.”</p>
<p>I sat on a nearby rock. “Then perhaps leaving isn’t your answer.”</p>
<p>He turned to face me, frustration burning in his eyes. “You just
drift through life, but I can’t live like that! I need—”</p>
<p>He stopped, as if he didn’t know the words.</p>
<p>I waited.</p>
<p>After a long silence, his shoulders sagged. Slowly, he turned back
toward me and walked past me, back toward the fire.</p>
<p>I said nothing as I followed.</p>
<p>We kept searching..</p>
<p>And then, at last, we found them.</p>
<p>The noble house stood tall against the sky, its gates heavy with
iron, its crest displayed proudly upon banners that did not waver in the
wind. The servants who greeted us stared in disbelief as they recognized
the young master they had thought lost.</p>
<p>The boy’s father was a stern man, with lines of worry carved deep
into his face. His mother, who had likely spent many nights awake in
fear, did not even try to speak. She only ran to him, clutched him
tight, and wept.</p>
<p>He did not push her away.</p>
<p>But he did not embrace her, either.</p>
<p>I watched him stand there, stiff and unmoving, as though he had
forgotten what warmth felt like.</p>
<p>Neia placed a hand on my arm, her grip firm. She knew what I was
thinking.</p>
<p>I had brought him home.</p>
<p>But was this where he truly belonged?</p>
<p>The nobleman was a towering figure, dressed in fine robes embroidered
with gold, his face lined with age and worry. His wife clutched their
son’s hand, tears streaming down her cheeks as she held him close, as if
afraid he would disappear again. The boy stood stiffly between them, his
expression caught between resentment and relief.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect you to understand why I left,” the boy muttered,
avoiding his father’s gaze.</p>
<p>“You’re our son,” his mother whispered, voice thick with emotion. “We
don’t need to understand—we just need you home.”</p>
<p>The noble father studied him for a long moment before giving a weary
sigh. “We will speak later.” His voice softened as he added, “For now,
rest.”</p>
<p>The boy gave a reluctant nod, his fingers tightening into fists.</p>
<p>I placed a hand on his shoulder. “I’ll visit when I can,” I said.</p>
<p>His scowl twitched slightly. “Don’t bother.”</p>
<p>Neia smiled and, to his horror, pulled him into a hug. His face
turned red instantly, and he struggled to pull away. “You’re such a
brat,” she teased, though her voice was gentle.</p>
<p>His father cleared his throat, and Neia finally let go, but not
before ruffling the boy’s hair. He shot her a glare, but there was no
real malice in it.</p>
<p>The boy stood at the gate, staring at the noble house as if it were
something distant, something foreign. His hands curled into fists, then
relaxed, then curled again.</p>
<p>I should have left already. But my feet did not move.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to stay,” Neia said softly. “You can still come with
us.”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he let out a slow breath,
shoulders slumping. “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”</p>
<p>I looked at him carefully, and for the first time since we met, I saw
it—the same look I once had. A boy standing at the edge of a world he
didn’t belong to. A boy searching for something he could not name.</p>
<p>And suddenly, I was unsure of myself.</p>
<p>“…Then what were you searching for?” I asked.</p>
<p>The boy’s fingers tightened at his sides. “Something that was mine.
Not my father’s. Not my mother’s. Just mine.” His voice was quieter now.
“But everything I found, I hated. Everything I tried, I failed at. And
now I’m here. Back where I started.”</p>
<p>I exhaled. “Nothing is ever the same once you leave it. Even if you
return, it will not be the place you once knew.”</p>
<p>The boy frowned, as if that thought unsettled him. “…Then what’s the
point?”</p>
<p>“The point,” I said, after a long pause, “is that you are not the
same either.”</p>
<p>Silence stretched between us.</p>
<p>I did not know if he understood. Perhaps I did not fully understand
myself. But I felt something shift in him—just as something was shifting
in me.</p>
<p>He let out a small breath. “So what am I supposed to do now?”</p>
<p>I looked at him, at the house, at the road that led away from it all.
I wanted to tell him that I did not know. That I never knew. That every
step I had taken had been without expectation, without seeking, without
believing there was ever an answer to begin with.</p>
<p>But I didn’t say any of that.</p>
<p>Instead, I placed a hand on his shoulder. “Find something worth
keeping.”</p>
<p>The boy stared at me, searching my face for something—an answer, a
reassurance, a truth.</p>
<p>I had nothing more to give.</p>
<p>His lips pressed into a thin line. Then, after what felt like
forever, he gave a slow nod.</p>
<p>I turned around.</p>
<p>“Do you think he’ll be alright?” Neia asked.</p>
<p>I looked up at the sky, at the clouds shifting without direction, at
the world that moved as it always had.</p>
<p>“He will find his way,” I said. “Or he won’t.”</p>
<p>I sighed. “Just like the rest of us.”</p>
<p>And though I did not say it aloud, a thought remained, lingering in
the quiet space between us:</p>
<p>And so will I.</p>
<p>A strange unease settled in me. I had left the boy behind, given him
my parting words, and yet, something gnawed at me. Neia walked beside me
in silence, but I could feel her eyes flickering toward me now and then.
She knew.</p>
<p>I had told the boy to find something worth keeping, but as the words
left my mouth, a question weighed on my mind—was I a fraud?</p>
<p>I had spent my life offering guidance, showing others the path they
could take, yet I had never truly known where I was going myself. If my
younger self stood before me now, what would I tell him? Would he
believe me?</p>
<p>I was not always like this. I was once a child with grand dreams,
dreaming of luxury, of success, of recognition. And now, I wandered with
nothing but the clothes on my back and the uncertainty of where my next
meal would come from. My younger self would look at me with scorn, with
disappointment. Was I truly at peace, or had I simply convinced myself
that this was the only path left?</p>
<p>The doubt gnawed at me, but as I searched within myself, I found my
answer. No matter what path I could have taken—whether I had chased
wealth, status, or comfort—I would have come to despise it. It would
have felt empty, suffocating, and eventually, I would have abandoned it
all to walk the very path I was on now. Not because it was easy, not
because it was abundant, but because it was the only path that felt like
my own.</p>
<p>And so, to the younger self I saw in the boy, I turned back and
answered:</p>
<p>“Your dreams were not your own. They were planted in you by a society
that does not know itself, by people who do not know what they
themselves want. This is a plague that spreads from one person to
another, filling their heads with desires that do not belong to them.
You believe you want wealth, power, success—but whose voice told you
that? Not your own.”</p>
<p>“And what about you? Have you found what you were looking for?” He
asked me.</p>
<p>I let out a slow breath.</p>
<p>Neia finally spoke, her voice careful. “You’re thinking too much
again.”</p>
<p>I gave her a small smile. “Maybe.”</p>
<p>She studied me for a moment before looking ahead. “You still believe
what you told him, don’t you?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>And yet, the feeling did not fade entirely. As we walked onward, into
lands unknown, I carried it with me—not as doubt, but as a quiet
reminder that even I was still searching.</p>
<p>Perhaps, like the boy, I always would be.</p>
<p>With that, we turned and left.</p>
<p>The air outside was heavy with the scent of rain on stone. The sky,
though bright, was overcast, casting the world in a muted light. I
walked ahead without speaking, feeling the weight of the past months
settle into my steps.</p>
<p>Neia followed in silence.</p>
<p>After some time, I spoke. “You should stay.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>I glanced back at her. “You’ve gained quite a reputation. People know
your name now. You could settle down somewhere, find a place to
belong.”</p>
<p>She scoffed. “Settle down and do what? Get married?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “It would be the normal thing to do.”</p>
<p>She laughed—a sharp, bitter sound. “You really don’t understand
anything, do you?”</p>
<p>I stopped walking. The sea stretched out before us, vast and untamed,
the waves rolling endlessly toward the shore.</p>
<p>Neia stepped beside me, her arms crossed, her expression
unreadable.</p>
<p>I exhaled. “I’m going to keep walking. Keep wandering. Until I find
peace or something close to it. It’s not a life worth following.”</p>
<p>She didn’t respond at first. The wind pulled at her dark hair,
carrying the scent of salt and something unspoken between us.</p>
<p>Then, quietly, she said, “If you’re a madman, then I must be mad
too.”</p>
<p>I turned my head slightly, watching her from the corner of my
eye.</p>
<p>She looked at me then—really looked at me. Her lips parted, as if she
wanted to say something more, but in the end, she just sighed and shook
her head.</p>
<p>We stood there for a long while, watching the waves crash against the
shore.</p>
<p>So be it.</p>
<p>As we stood there, my eyes were drawn to a child sitting alone by the
riverbank. He was no older than ten, carefully piling stones on top of
each other, only to watch them tumble back down.</p>
<p>I stopped without realizing it.</p>
<p>“Do you see something?” Neia asked, noticing my pause.</p>
<p>I didn’t answer. Instead, I walked toward the boy and sat beside him.
He glanced at me, wary at first, but when I said nothing, he returned to
his task.</p>
<p>“You’re trying to build something?” I asked after a moment.</p>
<p>“A tower,” he said simply. “But it always falls.”</p>
<p>I watched the stones crumble again. “Then why do you keep building
it?”</p>
<p>The boy frowned, as if the answer should have been obvious. “Because
I want to see if I can make it stand.”</p>
<p>I smiled at that. “And when it does?”</p>
<p>He hesitated, thinking for a long moment. “I don’t know… Maybe I’ll
make another one.”</p>
<p>A strange feeling stirred in my chest. I had no name for it, but it
lingered, heavy yet familiar.</p>
<p>I thought back to my younger self, the one who had wandered these
lands searching for something he could never quite grasp. I had met an
angel once, long ago, and without realizing it, I had spent my life
trying to reach her again. Even now, I found myself looking to the sky,
as if hoping to see her wings in the clouds.</p>
<p>The boy kept stacking his stones, but they fell again. He sighed,
frustrated.</p>
<p>“Would you like to know a trick?” I asked.</p>
<p>He nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>“If you press your hand against the earth before you start stacking,
you can feel where the ground is most stable. Place your first stone
there, and your tower will stand longer.”</p>
<p>He did as I said, pressing his small hands into the dirt, searching
for the right spot. Carefully, he stacked the stones again—this time
with patience, not frustration. When the tower stood taller than before,
his eyes lit up with quiet triumph.</p>
<p>“It worked!” he grinned.</p>
<p>Neia chuckled behind me, but I wasn’t looking at the boy’s tower.</p>
<p>I was looking at my own hands.</p>
<p>For years, I had followed the simplest path, the one that nature laid
before me, never questioning, never resisting. I had let the river carry
me without wondering where it led. But now, for the first time, I
wondered—had I been flowing toward something all along? Or had I just
been drifting?</p>
<p>That evening, as we sat by the fire, Neia hummed a familiar tune. I
had heard it before—the song she had sung to me on the night Ciel left.
A song that had asked for only a small place in my heart.</p>
<p>For a long time, I had given her nothing.</p>
<p>I watched the fire flicker, the light reflecting in Neia’s eyes as
she gazed into the flames. Her face was calm, accepting. She was not
waiting for me. Not anymore.</p>
<p>And yet, I reached out.</p>
<p>My fingers brushed against hers.</p>
<p>She tensed, surprised. Then she turned to me, searching my face for
answers I did not yet have.</p>
<p>I did not speak. I did not tighten my grip. I simply let my hand rest
there, against hers. A quiet acknowledgment. A simple truth.</p>
<p>It wasn’t something grand like <em>I love you</em> .</p>
<p>It was more like <em>I see you</em> .</p>
<p>Indeed, I don’t think I am capable of loving anyone. I just do what
occurs to me at the moment. I am not as kind as people tell me I am.</p>
<p>I think ill of people all the time, but I realize that expressing
such things would do me no good. I do not want to help anyone, but if I
don’t , I cannot earn my next meal. Therefore I keep my ill will to
myself and it appears like I am helping people, even though I am nowhere
as benevolent as people think I am.</p>
<p>I do not love anyone.</p>
<p>Neia did not move, did not ask for more.</p>
<p>For now, this was enough.</p>
<p>Years passed, and I continued my journey, wandering through villages,
forests, and distant lands. I did not seek anything, nor did I desire to
change anything. I simply followed the natural course, flowing like a
river that never stopped to question its direction. Have I changed ?
Perhaps. Eventually everything in nature changes. If that was not the
case, then nature could not have endured this long. If even nature
cannot resist change forever, then how much less can man ? The flow of
time is bound to change me. I’m sure that something, somewhere would
eventually , gradually, change me.</p>
<p>Neia remained by my side. She had long abandoned the hope that I
would return her feelings, yet she stayed—not because she waited for me
to change, but because she had come to love the life I led. I never
asked her to stay, just as I never asked her to leave. And so, we walked
together.</p>
<p>One evening, as the sky melted into hues of gold and crimson, I found
myself sitting beneath a tree by the stream, a familiar melody slipping
from my lips. I hadn’t meant to sing—I simply did. A song devoted to the
life I had lived, the love I had known, and the peace I had finally
begun to understand.</p>
<p>I sang of Ciel, of the love I had held for her, of my realization
that she was never meant to stay. I sang of Neia, of the one who had
always walked beside me, of the love I had never truly grasped until
now. I did not claim to love her in the way she once wished, nor did I
forget Ciel. Instead, I do not claim to have answers to any such things
either.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is wise to not have such wisdom.</p>
<pre><code>Once, I chased the echoes of a voice,
A whisper lost to time and sky,
She was light upon the morning mist,
A dream too far, yet held so high.

She taught me how the wind could speak,
That truth was not in walls of stone,
She smiled, and in that fleeting glance,
She left me searching all alone.

But rivers do not chase the clouds,
They only flow where they must go,
And love is not the grasping hand—
It’s the gentle tide, the drifting flow.

Years had passed like autumn leaves,
And yet, a voice remained so near,
Not calling me to chase the past,
But standing quiet, always here.

She never asked for more than this,
No wings, no stars, no endless height,
Just a place to rest beside the stream,
And walk with me beneath the light.

For rivers do not chase the clouds,
Yet still, the sky is always there,
It stays there like a fleeting wish—
One that stays so far yet so near.

To the sky I raise my hand,
Not to grasp, but to let go,
To the earth, I place my feet,
And walk the path that I now know.

The river flows, the sky remains,
One above and one below,
And wise is not the reaching hand—
It’s knowing when to let it go.

</code></pre>
<p>As my song faded into the evening breeze, I lifted my gaze—and there
she was.</p>
<p>Ciel- she stood across the stream, beneath the shade of an old
willow. The last light of the sun caught in her golden hair, making her
seem almost unreal. She had not changed—still light as air, still
belonging to a world beyond my reach.</p>
<p>For a moment, I wondered if I was dreaming. But then she stepped
forward, crossing the shallow water with bare feet, and I knew she was
real.</p>
<p>“Rimuru,” she said, her voice calm as ever, though I sensed a warmth
that had not been there before.</p>
<p>I smiled. “It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>We sat together on the soft grass, speaking as we once had—of the
wind, the rivers, the passing of time. There was no sorrow between us,
no regret. Just the quiet understanding of two souls who had once loved
each other in their own way.</p>
<p>The night deepened, and I felt the weight of the years settle upon
me—not as a burden, but as something gentle. My eyes grew heavy, and
before I realized it, my head had come to rest in her lap, just as it
had when I was a child. She did not move, only watching over me as my
breath slowed, as I drifted into sleep.</p>
<p>I woke to the sound of footsteps. Neia had returned from fetching
water. She paused at the sight before her—me, resting, and Ciel,
watching over me. For a moment, she was silent. Then she chuckled
softly.</p>
<p>“He looks like an innocent child when he’s sleeping,” she mused.</p>
<p>Ciel smiled. “He always did</p>
<p>She let out a quiet sigh. “I should go.”</p>
<p>Neia nodded. “Will you return?”</p>
<p>Ciel slowly shifted my head onto the grass as she stood.
“Someday.”</p>
<p>Then, with a mischievous glint in her eye, she leaned down and tapped
my forehead. “Wake up, dreamer.”</p>
<p>I stirred, blinking up at her face, still caught between sleep and
wakefulness. I sighed. “You always wake me up at the best parts.”</p>
<p>She chuckled. “Then dream faster next time.”</p>
<p>I knew that even if I did that , the angel of knowledge would know
exactly what I was dreaming and do the same thing again.</p>
<p>Not that I expected it to happen again. But it’s upto her, so there
is no point in thinking about it.</p>
<p>She stepped back, and the moonlight caught her form. Slowly, little
by little, she became one with the wind, her presence fading like a
whisper.</p>
<p>Before she disappeared entirely, she looked back at me one last
time.</p>
<p>“Live well,” she said. “And when we meet again, I hope you’ll have
more stories to tell.”</p>
<p>And then she was gone.</p>
<p>I stared at the spot where she had stood, then closed my eyes and let
out a deep breath.</p>
<p>I honestly wondered how an immortal , omniscient being lived her
life, never aging a day despite passing by millennia.</p>
<p>“She really never changes.” I murmured.</p>
<p>Neia sat down beside me, watching the same empty space. “Neither do
you.”</p>
<p>I chuckled. “Maybe.”</p>
<p>We sat together beneath the stars, listening to the murmuring stream.
There was no need for words. Somewhere, far beyond the reach of mortals,
I knew Ciel was watching. And when the time came, I would see her
again.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have walked many roads, but none of them have ever belonged to
me.</p>
<p>The people I have met, the lives I have touched—they were the heroes
of their own stories. I was only ever a passing spectator, the one who
passed through, watching as their journeys unfolded. They suffered, they
struggled, they found meaning, and in the end, they continued forward,
as they were always meant to.</p>
<p>And I? I simply walked alongside them.</p>
<p>People often ask me why I never seem to struggle. Why the world’s
hardships never seem to weigh on me. They don’t understand that it’s not
because life spares me, nor because I am beyond pain, but because I have
never thought of myself as someone meant to suffer. Hardships belong to
heroes, to those who fight and weep and rise again. I am none of those
things. I am only here to witness, to help where I can, and to move
forward.</p>
<p>I suppose that is why I have always been untouched by the burdens
others carry. I have never tried to claim them. I have never tried to be
kind to them. I place all of them before me, and so the world passes
through me like the wind through the trees. It does not linger, nor do I
try to hold onto it.</p>
<p>Ciel once told me that I loved her. I do not know if I ever truly
understood what that meant, but I know this: I never needed her to stay.
She was the wind, and the wind cannot be held. So I let her pass, just
as I have let all things pass.</p>
<p>Neia has walked by my side for years, though she no longer waits for
something that will never come. She sings songs of longing, but there is
peace in her voice now. Perhaps she has come to understand, just as I
have, that love does not have to be held to be real. That we do not have
to own something to treasure it.</p>
<p>So I walk, as I always have. I do not seek an ending, nor do I seek a
destination. A river does not ask where it flows, only that it
continues.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is what I have always been—a river that tried to carry
the weight of the sky only to realize later that the sky is carried
without needing to be carried. The river thus continues to be,
reflecting all that passes above it, including the sky, but never
stopping, never holding, never claiming.</p>
<p>And so, that river will keep flowing.</p>
<p>Because that is all I have ever known how to do.</p>
