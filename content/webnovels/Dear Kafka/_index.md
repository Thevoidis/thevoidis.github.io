What is this this story about ?
Justice ? Depression ? Delusion ? Hallucination ? I can't tell.

Kyton Nixot is a detectice/psychologist who wonders why he still continues to live on.
He stumbles on a murder case that looks like a serial killer's work, but finds out about deep rooted conspiracies that cause the matter.
Perhaps he can do something about it, but the question that plagues him more is - Why ?
