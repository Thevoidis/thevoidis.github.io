# Kyton

A dark room.
It stretches as far as the eye can see.
In the centre of it, a chair. The chair seems to be lit up by a spotlight from a ceiling that seems to high to fathom.
Kyton slowly approaches the chair with a sigh.
As if on cue, a desk fades into view a few feet in front of him.
The desk rises higher than his height , and a small platform appears beneath the desk.
Kyton didn't even consider leaving. He knew what would come next.
Wooden bars started to raise from the dark floor around Kyton.
Soon, he was in a cage.
At least he had a chair.
Kyton sits on the chair, waiting for the judges.
He takes in a breath, then another one. He kept taking in breaths , never exhaling.
Sure, that was possible.

His judges start appearing behind the desk.
They seem to have trouble deciding who would form tonight's panel, as many of them appeared and disappeared at will.
All of them were bringing up charges against Kyton, but they seemed to be unsure of which trial to conduct at the moment.
Kyton had too many charges, it seems.
Kyton pulled out the imaginary book he was writing from his pocket.
Every time he opens it, the book starts empty, but he continues in the book where he left off.
The book had a seal that read "How to not care a damn and disappoint your parents anyway"
As Kyton was wondering what to write down this time, the judges seemed to have made up their mind.

<!--
Kyton gets up early in the morning.
 He tries to cook something, but is unable to.
 He tries to tell himself that his health is more important than a case.
 His panel disagrees and starts accusing him of slacking off.
 He ignores them and lies down on a desk.
 he realizes which desk he is on and gets up and leaves.
 He goes to his office again, sees that no one would come, reads a detective story , only to have his "panel of judges" call him a child who fools himself.
 Among the panel , he sees his mother who used to beat him up, his father who he saw as a jobless drunkard who leeched off of his mother and his aunt.
 He saw his aunt who made him do all her housework for a wage that could barely earn him a meal.


He has enough of this and leaves his office at noon and goes to the police department and asks for his sessions with the unnamed woman.
 She appears to have calmed down , so Kyton tries to talk to her.
 The woman asks him what he thinks of himself (and this gives him trauma for some time, but he eventually comes back).
 The woman keeps pushing his buttons and asking whether he was fed (in a mocking way).
 It was evident from Kyton's appearance that he was poor , and the woman effortlessly pulled his strings where it hurt most.
 Kyton maintains his discipline and continues interrogating her, but starts questioning himself , asking him if he was even qualified to be a psychologist.
 The woman keeps taunting him, but he realizes that the woman is extremely good at reading people, acting , and manipulating them.
 Kyton finds it hard to keep it cool, and ends the session early , apolgizing to the officers , but still asking for the full pay.



Again , the officers oblige and tell him that they understand it is hard to deal with her, as she was initially very violent and knocked out two of their female officers, after which they only allowed male officers to take custody of her , with a female officer to keep watch (to comply with the rules).
 They told him that she mumbled some philosophical and depressing things at night to herself and would randomly start running and shouting, which is why they called a psychologist to attend to her.
 Kyton tells them that she might be schizophrenic, but that he's not sure whether it is real or an act.
 He tells them that it might just be an act to get food and shelter, but again, that he isn't too sure.


The officers encourage him to keep at it until her trail at the end of the next week (The court was filled with an unusually large number murder cases of street dwellers and elderly people, so her trial was delayed).
 The officers ask him for a drink again, which he refuses again.
 Just before leaving, the officers remark that this was the first time since the 'Tao incident' that the courts were this full.
 Kyton nods as he goes back home, not wanting to bring up that memory.

Kyton heads off to the outskirts of the city for a walk.
 He notices how there were no important landmarks here,only broken buildings.
 He wonders if he could live in any of them if he ever had to give up his home out of debt.

Kyton's house was ill-maintained, not just from his meager savings, but also from his general negligence.
 He only did repairs when they were absolutely necessary.
 He didn't have heating or proper plumbing.
 It was already falling apart.
 Before, he would do side jobs to maintain it a little.
 Now, his mental state made it difficult for him to do even that.
 Kyton didn't stay there out of convenience.
 He stayed there because it was the only thing left for him.
 He wasn't maintaining the house - the house was maintaining him.


Kyton gets up in the morning, has breakfast by himself and thinks about going to office, but he decides not to.
 He walks straight up to the police department only to find that it doesn't let visitors in until half an hour later.
 As he sits on the stairs, he notices a black car driving to the police department building.
 An old man in a blue longcoat comes out of it, escorted by people who look like mafia security guards.


As they pass by Kyton, they ask the officers to open despite the police not taking visitors at the time until it was an emergency.
 The man's guards threaten to fire the officers from their posts, hearing which the officers let them in.
 Kyton glares at the old man , and the old man just ignores him.
 Kyton has a feeling that he had seen the man before, but decides that it is probably some corrupt politician or mafia person who has come to bribe the police.
 They speak with the police for about ten minutes and sure enough, Kyton could smell corruption.
 The old man comes out and throws a stack of banknotes at Kyton, as his guards ask him to keep shut about this encounter.


Kyton goes in after the office opens , and asks what that was about.
 The officers knew that Kyton was not the kind to expose corruption, so they told him what it was about - that they had come to ask about evidences to the Tao case.
 Kyton says that he he wants to hear no more, since that was a case which the greatest detectives of the last generation could not solve.


Kyton goes on to talk to the mysterious woman again, this time ignoring her taunts.
 The woman is intrigued and tells him that he has improved.
 Kyton then tries standard psychological practices, going back and forth between behavioural neuroscience and classical psychoanalysis to understand this woman.
 But because of the sheer lack of information on her, all he could come up with was vague theories, all of which she just laughed at.
 Kyton starts to question himself and asks his judges to shut up, but it ends up being too loud.
 Then , as a way to console himself, he asks the woman "Have you ever had the feeling that there are people watching you all the time, looking at your life like observers, and you feel insecure, and the only thing you feel is that you have to prove yourself to them ?"

This forces a reaction out of the woman.
 She stays silent for sometime, thinking that the question was meant for her.
 Kyton meant it as a rhetorical question, but she did not know that.
 Kyton guessed that he had said something relevant, but he apologised.

"Did I say something strange ?"
She looked at him quizzically, then shook her head.

She then spoke slowly "You can call me Kafka".


Kyton is surprised at her reaction, then intrigued at her name.
 But he decides to go with it.

He asks her about her past.
 She thinks for a moment , and asks why she should tell him.

He had no answer for that.
 The female officer overseeing their conversation steps in and tells Kafka that the court has been criticising the police for not finding the serial killer who was causing so many murders , and that she is one of the suspects.
 She tells her that if she doesn't oblige, then she'll be the scapegoat for fabricated evidence just to keep the public satisfied.

Kyton is surprised at that, because for two days he had not even noticed that there was any officer overseeing their conversation, because he was too busy dealing with his ghosts and Kafka.


Kafka asks the officers to go away ,to which they agree.
 Kafka looks at Kyton, trying to intimidate him ,and asks him if he can be trusted.
 Kyton nods.
 Kafka looks at the ceiling and asks what kind of punishment she would get.
 Kyton tells her that he doesn't know the specifics of her case, only that he was asked to wring out answers from her.
 Kafka lays down on the table , covering her head with her hands, asking Kyton to leave.
 He thinks for a moment , and asks her if she means it.
 She sighs and then laugh hysterically.
 Kyton tells her to stop the act.
 Kafka asks him why he thinks she's acting.
 Kyton replies that he doesn't know.


They keep talking without any meaning for a few more hours, and Kyton leaves for the day, going to the market on the way to buy some food on the way to go home.


The following day, Kyton comes to the station on time and asks for his daily counsel with Kafka.
 He is troubled that he could not make progress, but the officers try to cheer him on, telling him that he's doing a good job, despite his own self doubt.
 The officers had their hands full as the court filled with cases, so for them , having Kyton there to deal with Kafka and locating the killer was a much appreciated support.


As he goes on to meet Kafka, the female officer that he met the day before told him that Kafka was crying in her cell all night.
 Kyton wanted to ask the officer her name but decided against it.
 Every time he got involved with anyone, he ended up suffering.
 He had learnt this lesson throughout his childhood and youth.
 Every time he tried to be kind to someone, they abused him.


Kyton heads on to find Kafka with bags under her eyes.
 He tells her to sleep well, but she replied that she could not get any sleep.
 Kyton tells her that he once read an article that sleep was essential even if there was a war going on, and Kafka smiles weakly , calling it a bad joke.
 She asks how Kyton is able to sleep well despite how troubled he looks, and that she only got to sleep well in isolated places.
 Kyton tells her that the case was quite the reverse- that he slept to keep his mind at rest, that for years he had never had dreams, that sleep is the only time he had peace.
 Kafka tells him that she is jealous and that she is traumatised every time she sleeps.
 Kyton asks her about her dreams.


Kafka tells him that she imagines her parents , her old "inmates" , her "caretakers" , all watching her life as if watching a theater, all silent.
 She was put on the stage without being asked, and she was nervous.
 She is scared initially , but the audience never responds.
 They never speak.
 She tries to invoke a reaction from them, but they never react.
 Then she 'killed" someone- She was scared- but also thrilled - that the audience would finally say something.
 But they didn't.
 Then she thought- how about she make them fear her- how about she show them terror - show them that she is to be feared- so she "killed" more, each time she did it, she was more ecstatic , believing the audience would cower in terror.
 But they never budged.
 They never talked.
 Kafka was scared.

She didn't know what to do.


Kyton listens to this and takes notes, something which he had forgot to do before.
 He asks her what she meant by "inmates", "caretakers" and "killings".
 She did not respond.
 He asked her how her family was.
 She did not respond.
After a period of silence, Kyton sighed and gave up on taking notes and gave the note to her, and asked her to take notes from him if she wanted to.
 He turns the tables on her and asks her to analyse him.
 Kafka finds it curious, but she agrees, being slightly confused.


Kyton starts telling her his story - About how he was abused, his parents committed a double suicide, how his relatives were killed by an unknown murderer known as Tao (and has not been found to date), how every time someone adopted him , they were killed.
 Eventually , in his youth, he started working , doing menial jobs by himself until he could save up to learn forensics and become a detective.
 While doing that, he realized how talented and smart everyone else in the business was.
 He felt inferior.
 When he barely passed university, he thought that his life was doomed.
 He had lost all his savings, and he had no prospects to look for.
 Yet , he persevered, did odd jobs until he could open an office for himself.
 He got very few clients, and had to live off of his odd jobs.
 Amidst all of this, he realized he had been carrying the ghosts all along- those panel of judges.
 He didn't take them seriously in his childhood, thinking that they were some temporary musing , but he realizes that it is a chronic mental disorder.
 He becomes so involved in his hallucinations day by day until he could no longer concentrate on the menial jobs that fed him, forcing him to live solely on the detective job that kept him occupied.
 He decides to take a psychology course to "fix" himself - but it ends up being a waste of time and money.
 In his words, "Psychology is a pseudoscience that makes you think you are smart, but you are just taking out baseless assumptions like an astrologer, and all you learn in three years is this scam.
" He grows to hate psychology, but being a "professional" psychologist now, he was all into the idea of counselling patients if it meant getting income to feed himself.
 Eventually, the number of patients decrease , many claiming that Kyton had no life in him, and that he was unable to cure them of their ailments.
 Kyton, meanwhile, suffered more from his feeling of inferiority.
 This has been the case for years.
 Sometimes he had to go for up to a week without food.
 He had considered abandoning his job and becoming a thief, but decided against it because he thought he wouldn't be good for that either.
 He thought he was good for nothing.
 

As Kyton said this, he wept.
 Kafka stared at him ,not taking any notes.
