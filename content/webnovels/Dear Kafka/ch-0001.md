## Kyton

The eyes were always there.
Not real eyes, not reflections in a rain-slicked window or the passing glance of a stranger on the street.
These were heavier.
They pressed against the inside of his skull, a phantom weight behind his own gaze. 
Freedom? Freedom was a word for people who didn't carry their own courtroom inside their head.

Kyton was a man who could disappear any day. No one would notice or care.
Perhaps the owners of his rented office would worry a bit about them not recieving payment after he is gone.
Perhaps his neighbours will complain about the unkept house after he is gone.
No one else would actually care.

At least other people weren't havign a good life.
Not that he cared.
"More murders on the streets - is anyone safe anymore ?"
Was that supposed to be a catchphrase ?
Why were people so concerned about thugs dying on the streets ?
"Disabled man found dead on the alleyways."
"Three elderly women found dead at the riverside."
"Backlogs in courts all time high since the war."
"Are the streets safe for the poor anymore ?"
Those were the headings on the papers these days.

Atleast he was slightly better off now.
Today he recieved a call while he was in his office from an acquaintance.
The police, rather. They wanted him to question a possibly insane murder suspect.
Fine by him. That was the first real work that he got in a while.
Maybe he could get a full feast today for dinner.
He liked lone feasts. It calmed his despairs for some time.
