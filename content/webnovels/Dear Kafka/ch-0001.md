## Kyton

The eyes were always there.
Not real eyes, not reflections in a rain-slicked window or the passing glance of a stranger on the street.
These were heavier.
They pressed against the inside of his skull, a phantom weight behind his own gaze. 
Freedom? Freedom was a word for people who didn't carry their own courtroom inside their head.

Kyton was a man who could disappear any day. No one would notice or care.
Perhaps the owners of his rented office would worry a bit about them not recieving payment after he is gone.
Perhaps his neighbours will complain about the unkept house after he is gone.
No one else would actually care.

At least other people weren't havign a good life.
Not that he cared.
"More murders on the streets - is anyone safe anymore ?"
Was that supposed to be a catchphrase ?
Why were people so concerned about thugs dying on the streets ?
"Disabled man found dead on the alleyways."
"Three elderly women found dead at the riverside."
"Backlogs in courts all time high since the war."
"Are the streets safe for the poor anymore ?"
Those were the headings on the papers these days.

Atleast he was slightly better off now.
Today he recieved a call while he was in his office from an acquaintance.
The police, rather. They wanted him to question a possibly insane murder suspect.
Fine by him. That was the first real work that he got in a while.
Maybe he could get a full feast today for dinner.
He liked lone feasts. It calmed his despairs for some time.

Kyton stood in front of the police station wondering when he should go in. Seeing that he had been standing there for over an hour, one of the officers came out to meet him.
"Why are you standing there, Mr.Nixot ? I did invite you to interrofate a suspect."  The officer asked.
Kyton ignored him and went into the station. He knew this officer for a few decades now, but he always tried not to talk to him.
The officer followed him back and continued talking "She seems to be mentally challenged. She refuses to answer any of our questions, and screams all night."
"So you brought a detective with a matching personality, Jamie ?" asked a female officer who was lying on a desk nearby.
"It was nothing of the sort ! He has a good track record !"
"Then why don't you question her yourself ? Or let me handle it ?"
"I can't.." Officer Jamie fell silent.
The female officer looked at in confusion.

Kyton observed the exchange without saying  a word. The motive of the police was none of his concern.
Jamie took Kyton to a cell a little bit inside the station. There was just one woman in it. She was hancuffed, but the looked unnecessary. 
She was in such a malnourished state that Kyton wondered if she could actually escape even if she wanted to.
But she had a strange charm in her own way. Perhaps she would look better if given proper treatment ?
Was she some abandoned noblewoman ? Kyton had the vague feeling that he had seen her somewhere.

Jamie informed Kyton about the matter at hand. To put it briefly, she was a suspect for the recent serial murders. It seems that she was found in an alley at night where she didn't even try to defend herself.
It was unlikely that she was directly responsible for any of the crimes, but the police wanted to know if she could lead them to actual suspects.
Sounds innocent on paper. But both Kyton and Jamie knew that it was not this simple.
The police did not actually want to solve any case here.
They were just a screenplay for the underworld.
'Murder' was a fear. And the underworld could not afford to have that fear unleashed on the masses.
So someone had to take the blame. Perhaps the media would be bribed to stop talking about further murders, but the ones that were done had already caught public attention.
That had to be buried. Someone was to be held responsible.
This woman was probably going to be a scapegoat for that purpose.
The real reason Kyton was here was to convince her to submit to her fate as a scapegoat.
The police was never going to find the real culprit. Because whoever the culprit turned out to be, the officers involved in the case would have to face consequences.
The government and the underworld were publicly at war, but everyone knew that they were accomplices behind the scenes.
In sucha country , the role of the police was to cover up crimes in whatever ways they could.

This was why a psychologist was told to 'interrogate' the subject. Kyton was the perfect cover because he wa also a detective.
The police might say that they needed Kyton the detective , but what they really needed was Kyton the psychologist.
To manipulate victims to become scapegoats on whom the blame of crimes of other people were dumped on if the case came to that.

Usually , it never came to this, which is why Kyton was rarely called.
But this was different. This was serial murder.
Whoever was responsible was smart , and the police couldn't hope to get caught in that.
The chances that the officers themselves might get killed is high.
So the wise choice was to let the actual killer do whatever he wanted and cover up the story for now.
This was probably why Jamie found it hard to interrogate the woman. He was faint of heart.

Kyton sat on a chair in the cell facing the woman.
She did not try to struggle , but did not speak either.
Perhaps from her lack of nutrition ?
Well , at least he had time.
Jamie had told him that her trial was due in two weeks because the court was just full of so many murder cases.
There were some formalitiles to be done before a scapegoat was preseneted.
The police should act like they were investigating, make some false files, some false roadblocks, make a whole story on how the victim was hard to catch, and then,
once a believable amount of time has passed , the scapegoat would be first introduced to court, and a few trials later , would be convicted.
That was the drill.

But it seemed that bainwashing had to wait.
This person might die if she doesn't get fed soon.
Kyton got up from his chair and moved closer to inspect the 'suspect'.
Jamie stopped him.
"She might look frail, Mr.Nixot, but she had already beaten up two of our female officers despite being handcuffed."
"Oh really, but she looks pretty.  I just wanted a closer look." the words slipped from Kyton.
Jamie looked at Kyton him in confusion.
The woman looked at Kyton with murder in her eyes.
Well, that was to be expected.
